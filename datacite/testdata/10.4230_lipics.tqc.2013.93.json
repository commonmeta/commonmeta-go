The cardinality of the smallest unextendible product basis is known in all qubit cases except when the number of parties is a multiple of 4 greater than 4 itself. We construct small unextendible product bases in all of the remaining open cases, and we use graph theory techniques to produce a computer-assisted proof that our constructions are indeed the smallest possible.","type":"Abstract","language":"en"},{"description":"LIPIcs, Vol. 22, 8th Conference on the Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication and Cryptography (TQC 2013), pages 93-105","type":"Other","language":"en"}],"files":[],"provider":"DataCite","schema_version":"https://commonmeta.org/commonmeta_v0.12","state":"findable"}
