      "description": "These are raw wing images from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> isofemale lines collected from Sub-Saharan Africa by John Pool. The progeny from these lines eclosed and then one wing was dissected from each individual (~20 males and females from each line). Imaged at 20X total magnification (2X objective) on an Olympus BX-51 microscope.<br>Please note. It looks like some images did not transfer successfully, but there is no easy way on figshare of getting a list of files, so I may need to re-upload all of them.<br><br>",
