A qualitative approach has been adopted, using case study as research method: ﬁve in-depth, semi-structured interviews to Digital Humanities scholars provide data integrated with interviews with two key informants (one of which is prof.

The results of the study show that Humanities, within Italian context, do appreciate collaboration and the concept of a collaboratory digital library, though several issues need to be solved. In fact, Humanities are still tied with individual work and collaboration is not easy to pursue, for cultural, technical and political reasons.

When sectors of economicactivities are taken into \nconsideration, accidents were preponderant in Services (50.1%), followed by \nthe Transformation sector (36.4%). Accidents resulting in temporary \nincapac- ity for work reached 32.8%, whilst 2,800 workers died annually \nfrom labor accidents.

This allows to formulate a universe model with a variable metric by which some of its fundamental aspects are explained: the Hubble’s law is explained by creating the mass-space, the acceleration of galaxies is the eﬀect of a past with open metric, the age of the universe is the time needed to reaching the ﬂat metric phase and the dark mass is a consequence of the presence of a background massive-lattice. Finally, the origin of galaxies is connected to the formation of primordial black holes made of scalar bosons with Planck’s mass.

This observational based approach does not fulfill all the properties one would expect from an explanation. In particular, it does not include any notion of causality.\n\nIn this thesis, we investigate how causality can be used to allow for an interpretation of explanations as statements of cause and effect, between a hypothesis and observations. We detail how factor graphs can be used as an abstraction of Bayesian networks to perform efficient probabilistic inference in Bayesian network with the aim of using these methods to find explanations.\n\nWe provide a critique of existing approaches to explanation, and list the requirements for explanations that consider cause-effect relationships. We propose an algorithm for finding explanations that allows for causal interpretation as well as probabilistic. The algorithm is based on the concept of causal information flow and the search for explanations is inspired by feature selection.\n\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on two sample networks. The results are compared with those of existing approaches and we conclude that our proposed algorithm finds explanations that satisfy the requirements we defined for causal explanations."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Thesis"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-06-19T13:22:45Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"causality"},{"subject":"Bayesian networks"},{"subject":"factor graphs"},{"subject":"graphical models"},{"subject":"explanation"},{"subject":"abduction"},{"subject":"most probable explanation"}],"dates":[{"date":"2007-09-03","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2007-09-03","titles":[{"title":"On Causal Explanations In Bayesian Networks"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/6943","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2007,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[{"nameType":"Personal","affiliation":[{"name":"IT University of Copenhagen"}],"givenName":"Peter","familyName":"Sestoft","name":"Sestoft, Peter","contributorType":"Supervisor"},{"nameType":"Personal","affiliation":[{"name":"IBM Zurich Research Laboratory"}],"givenName":"André","familyName":"Elisseeff","name":"Elisseeff, André","contributorType":"Supervisor"}],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:04:14Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.6943","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

By implementing the OpenAIRE Guidelines data archive managers are facilitating the creation of enhanced publications and building the stepping-stones for a linked data infrastructure for research. Exposure and visibility of content from a range of European repositories will be significantly increased when a common and interoperable approach is taken and care to adhere to existing guidelines.

However, the\ndifference between the design principles of the emerging domainspecific\nlanguages imposes serious challenges in the following\nre-design phases. Moreover, enabling evolutions on the business\nprocess models while keeping them synchronized with the underlying\nsoftware architecture models is of high relevance to the key\nelements of any Business Driven Development (BDD). Given a\nbusiness process update, this paper introduces an incremental\nmodel transformation approach that propagates this update\nto the related service component configurations. It, therefore,\nsupports the change propagation among heterogenous domainspecific\nlanguages, e.g., the BPMN and the SCA.

These were obtained from separate ice dynamics and surface mass balance models for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and by a regionalized mass balance model for glaciers and ice caps. For our mid-range scenario, the ice melt component of total sea-level change attains its largest amplitude in the equatorial oceans, where we predict a cumulative sea-level rise of ~ 25 cm and rates of change close to 3 mm/yr from ice melt alone by 2100. According to our modeling, in low-elevation densely populated coastal zones, the gravitationally consistent sea-level variations due to continental ice loss will range between 50 and 150% of the global mean. This includes the effects of glacial-isostatic adjustment, which mostly contributes across the lateral forebulge regions in North America. While the mid range ocean-averaged elastic-gravitational sea-level variations compare with those associated with thermal expansion and ocean circulation, their combination shows a complex regional pattern, where the former component dominates in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean and the latter in the Arctic Ocean."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-07-24T14:00:19Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"future sea level change"},{"subject":"terrestrial ice loss"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-23","titles":[{"title":"The Gravitationally Consistent Sea-Level Fingerprint Of Future Terrestrial Ice Loss"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/6996","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:07:01Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.6996","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

To explore the underlying encoding strategies in the early stages of visual information processing, we presented participants with L-, T-, and X-junctions in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. For each junction type, we manipulated the amount of configuration regularity (or degrees of constraint), ranging from a generic junction configuration to stimuli resembling an ‘L’ (i.e., a right angle L-junction), a ‘T’ (i.e., a right angle midpoint T-junction), or a ‘+’. We found that the response strength in the shape-selective lateral occipital area was consistently lower for a higher degree of regularity in the stimuli. In the second experiment, using multivoxel pattern analysis we further show that regularity is encoded in terms of the fMRI signal strength but not in the distributed pattern of responses. Finally, we found that the results of these experiments could not be accounted for by two well-known theoretical proposals for constructing stimulus interpretation, namely, the Structural Information Theory and the Minimal Model Theory, at least not without additional assumptions in those theories. Our results suggest that regularity plays an important role in stimulus encoding in the ventral visual processing stream."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Poster"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-07-30T14:29:16Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[],"dates":[{"date":"2013-08-26","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-08-26","titles":[{"title":"Encoding Of Regularity In The Visual Cortex"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/6999","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:08:12Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.6999","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The activators have been purified from the cytosolic fractions of the gastric and kidney tissue and partially characterized. The HAF is a dimer two identical 40 k Da subunits in the active state while the active NaAF is a monomer of 170 k Da. The gradient purified plasma membrane fractions of low and high buoyant densities derived from gastric as well as the kidney show similar kinds of stimulation by the respective activators. Also, the response of the activator stimulated activities to Ca showing abolition of the activator-stimulated component at higher physiological range was qualitatively similar for both. In addition the response to vanadate inhibition of the activator stimulated ATPase activities were virtually identical.

While a number of models for each grouping principle have been proposed, a unifying architecture that would flexibly incorporate all of them is still lacking. Moreover, many of these models operate in mathematical terms, rendering them unsuitable for a wider testing on real input images. Here we present a generic biologically plausible unsupervised architecture, which we term gmin (https://github.com/qbilius/gmin), geared towards a unified implementation of the grouping principles. The model operates by extracting a certain feature of interest from an input image (e.g., edges) and selecting maximally informative units to decrease computational load; then it proceeds to iteratively compute grouping strength between all pairs of units and update informative unit selection using a particular grouping principle (e.g., good continuation). This process is repeated for all features of interest. Finally, a segmentation of an image into (provisional) objects is provided by an unsupervised learning procedure on the computed grouping strengths, such as clustering or belief propagation. We illustrate the validity and the general usefulness of our approach by testing it on a few very different grouping displays. Using the cues of proximity, good continuation, or orientation similarity, we were able to obtain a satisfying model performance on the classic Gestalt displays of dot lattices, contour integration, and texture segregation."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Poster"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-09-23T14:49:14Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"image segmentation"},{"subject":"perceptual organization"},{"subject":"Gestalt"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-09-25","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-09-25","titles":[{"title":"A Generic Model Architecture For Perceptual Grouping"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7118","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:09:49Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7118","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Extending the approach of Mouritsen (1996) based on the importance attached to accountants’ activities and using data from an international survey of over 3,000 professionally qualified management accountants, it is found that the importance of activities associated with this role is widely recognised, but only as part of a mix of other services provided by accountants.  Furthermore, the importance of business partnering activities varies dependent on characteristics of the firm and the accountant, which we interpret in terms of selective adoption of the role driven by institutional factors, such as isomorphic pressure, operational complexity and the ability to resource business partnering after meeting priority demands for other services, and the propensity of the individual accountant to perform the role.  Thus, understanding of the development of a more business-oriented role for accountants should recognise its complementarity to other services demanded of the finance function and the conditions that support its practice by the individual accountant."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Working paper"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-10-13T09:08:14Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Accountant's Activities"},{"subject":"Role change"},{"subject":"Business Partnering"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-10-13","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-10-13","titles":[{"title":"Business Partnering As A Complement To Accountant'S Other Roles: International Survey Evidence"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7165","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:12:12Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7165","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

This data paper presents the results of a test series on six identical unreinforced masonry walls that were constructed using hollow clay brick units and standard cement-based mortar. The test units were subjected to quasi-static cycles of increasing drift demands and the tests differed with regard to the applied axial load and the moment restraint applied at the top of the walls.

Production rates of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and<br>\nbackground corrected Ox (background corrected O3 + NO2), Ox’ were quantified using the<br>\nhorizontal flux divergence approach by flying closed loops near Bakersfield, CA. By<br>\nmaking concurrent measurements of the trace gases as well as the wind fields, we have<br>\ngreatly reduced the uncertainty due to wind field in production rates.<br>\nResults: We find that the entire region is a source for both NO2 and Ox’. NO2 production\n\nis highest over the city (1.35 kg hr-1 km-2 NO2), and about 30 times lower at background<br>\nsites (0.04 kg hr-1 km-2 NO2).

The Ox’ production is less<br>\nvariable, found ubiquitous, and accounts for 7.4 kg hr-1 km-2 Ox’ at background sites.<br>\nInterestingly, the maximum of 17.1 kg hr-1 km-2 Ox’ production was observed upwind of<br>\nthe city.

It does not take into account link quality information. While some link metrics try to estimate channel properties based on layer-3 observations, more sophisticated metrics need to access layer-2 information directly. The new 802.11 netlink interface provides a common local interface for Linux based systems and thus the basis for practical usage in community networks. However, a standardized radio-to-router communication protocol to access layer-2 information will allow to go beyond the limitations of having all radio interfaces built directly into the router device. While the PPPoE protocol generally can be applied to this scenario, it has some drawbacks when used in wireless mesh networks. The new DLEP protocol is supported by the IETF MANET group to fill this gap. In this paper we describe the advantages of a flexible node design for community networks based on the DLEP protocol. In addition, we present our implementation of the DLEP protocol and discuss some important deviations from the current draft version of the standard."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Conference paper"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-10-21T07:13:34Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"DLEP"},{"subject":"CONFINE"},{"subject":"community networks"},{"subject":"IETF"},{"subject":"radio-to-router"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-10-21","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-10-21","titles":[{"title":"Improved Community Network Node Design Using A Dlep Based Radio-To-Router Interface"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7459","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:12:25Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7459","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Its performance is evaluated in comparison with OLSR in terms of overhead and convergence time as networks grow in number of nodes and diameter. The results show that the convergence time and protocol overhead per node in BMX6 is not significantly affected by the addition of new nodes in contrast with OLSR, where both parameters can grow super-linearly.

Yet, they suffer from two major problems: inefficiency and unfairness. A number of approaches have been proposed to tackle these problems, but they are too restrictive, highly complex, or require time synchronization and modifications to the IEEE 802.11 MAC.\n\nPACE is a simple multi-hop scheduling mechanism for Stub WMNs overlaid on the IEEE 802.11 MAC that jointly addresses the inefficiency and unfairness problems. It limits transmissions to a single mesh node at each time and ensures that each node has the opportunity to transmit a packet in each network-wide transmission round. Simulation results demonstrate that PACE can achieve optimal network capacity utilization and greatly outperforms state of the art CSMA/CA-based solutions as far as goodput, delay, and fairness are concerned."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Conference paper"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-10-22T08:43:01Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"IEEE 802.11"},{"subject":"CONFINE"},{"subject":"single-radio"},{"subject":"wireless mesh network"},{"subject":"scheduling"},{"subject":"multihop"},{"subject":"fairness"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-10-07","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-10-07","titles":[{"title":"Pace: Simple Multi-Hop Scheduling For Single-Radio 802.11-Based Stub Wireless Mesh Networks"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7476","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:12:59Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7476","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Energy from ocean waves may once play a contributing role towards this step but is as yet in its fledgling stages. This is mainly due to the harsh sea environment, which implies the need for simple and robust wave energy converter. The work presented in this thesis picks up this thought when dealing with the so-called WaveGyro. Introductory chapters explain how this novel concept arose, followed by a detailed explanation of the working principle.<br> The WavGyro utilizes gyroscopes to provide an internal reaction moment against the wave excitation. This internal reaction permits designing a completely enclosed and thus environmentally resistant device. The gyroscopic precession is used to convert the wave-induced moment into a moment that accelerates the flywheels. Equations of motion, which describe the gyroscope kinetics, are deduced. The gyroscopic motions and moment is then implemented into the first-order wave hydrodynamics. Two main approaches to describe the wave excitation are presented. The first approach is superposition of radiation and exci-tation and the second approach makes use of the relative motion principle, which relates the excitation to the extent of displacement. Both approaches are employed to deduce the maximum power capture condition in relation to the device’s dimensions and operational parameters.<br> The influence of real sea state, analytically expressed by the Pierson-Moskowitz spec-trum, on the optimum power analysis is considered and implementation methods are de-veloped. Subsequently the spin-up mechanism is explained and examined; this is the mechanism converting the precession moment into torque accelerating the flywheel. It is shown that a simple configuration, composed of an ordinary cogwheel and a sprag-clutch only is not sufficient for this mechanism. Ideas for alternative mechanisms are considered but require further investigation to allow conclusive results.<br> Finally, an approximate plan for the design of model is developed, which includes basic considerations of scaling laws. Recommendations for further theoretical and practical work on the WaveGyro are provided."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":4,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Thesis"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[{"relationType":"IsVersionOf","relatedIdentifier":"10.5281/zenodo.642179","relatedIdentifierType":"DOI"},{"relationType":"IsPartOf","relatedIdentifier":"https://zenodo.org/communities/zenodo","relatedIdentifierType":"URL"}],"created":"2013-10-24T10:40:09Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"wave energy"},{"subject":"wave power"},{"subject":"ocean energy"},{"subject":"energy conversion"},{"subject":"power capture"},{"subject":"wave energy conversion"},{"subject":"gyroscope"},{"subject":"gyro"},{"subject":"WaveGyro"},{"subject":"wave hydrodynamics"},{"subject":"Froude-Krylov force"},{"subject":"wave load"},{"subject":"power take-off"},{"subject":"optimum power capture"},{"subject":"Powerball"},{"subject":"Dynabee"},{"subject":"Gyro Twister"},{"subject":"ocean engineering"},{"subject":"renewable energy"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-09-26","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-09-26","titles":[{"title":"The WaveGyro"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7480","rightsList":[{"rightsIdentifierScheme":"SPDX","rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","schemeUri":"https://spdx.org/licenses/","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","rightsIdentifier":"cc-by-4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[{"affiliation":[{"name":"University of Southampton"}],"givenName":"Grant E.","familyName":"Hearn","name":"Hearn, Grant E.","contributorType":"Supervisor"}],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:13:33Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7480","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

It applied approximate dynamic programming (here, neuro-dynamic programming - whose approximation of stochastic dynamic programming relies on artificial neural networks) to the integrated water resources management. The methodology is general enough to be potentially useful in other problems of integrated natural resources modelling and management (INRMM).\n\n<em><strong>Machine learning in water resources management: why. </strong></em>Efficiently and sustainably managing water resources is a challenging problem due to the variety of criteria to be considered, some of them conflicting (e.g. protecting human lives and economic assets from floods, supplying drinking water, water for agriculture and energy production, preserving ecosystems in lakes, rivers and canals along with their ecosystem services). Furthermore, the climate-driven influences on water systems (such as precipitation, snow accumulation/melt and runoff in river flow and floods, temperature and evapotranspiration in crop fields) are extremely nonlinear phenomena which require robust stochastic approaches. This led advanced machine learning techniques (e.g. stochastic dynamic programming) to become well-established solutions.\n\n<em><strong>Failing with complex water systems: the curse of dimensionality.</strong></em> The problem with dynamic programming is that its strong ability to cope with highly nonlinear problems has a limit in the number of dimensions that the modelled system requires. Systems demanding a high number of dimensions cause the computational cost of dynamic programming to explode. For example, water systems with several reservoirs fall within this category of high dimensionality.\n\n<em><strong>Renouncing to prohibitive exact solutions for exploring good approximated ones. </strong></em>Approximate dynamic programming greatly mitigates this problem: in this article, the approximation relies on artificial neural networks of a particular class (multilayer perceptron) with proved ability to approximate general, complex functions. Tests on a real-world water system confirmed here, for the first time, the extent of improvement.\n\n \n\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\n\nThe management of a water reservoir can be improved thanks to the use of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) to generate management policies which are efficient with respect to the management objectives (flood protection, water supply for irrigation and hydropower generation, respect of minimum environmental flows, etc.). The improvement in efficiency is even more remarkable when the problem involves a reservoir network, that is a set of reservoirs which are interconnected. Unfortunately, SDP is affected by the “curse of dimensionality” and computing time and computer memory occupation can quickly become unbearable. Neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) can sensibly reduce the demands on computer time and memory thanks to the approximation of Bellman functions with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this paper an application of neuro-dynamic programming to the problem of the management of reservoir networks is presented.<br>\n \n\n \n\nCite as: de Rigo, D., Rizzoli, A.E., Soncini-Sessa, R., Weber, E., Zenesi, P.

Due to the lack of direct observations of stellar winds from Sun-like stars stellar X-ray luminosity and stellar level of activity are commonly used as a proxy for estimating stellar mass-loss rates. However, such an intuitive activity - mass-loss rate relation is not well defined. In this paper, I study the mass-loss rate of the Sun as a function of its activity level. I compare in situ solar wind measurements with the solar activity level represented by the solar X-ray flux. I find no clear dependency of the solar mass flux on solar X-ray flux. Instead, the solar mass-loss rate is scattered around an average value of 2 × 10-14 M⊙ yr-1. This independency of the mass-loss rate on level of activity can be explained by the fact that the activity level is governed by the large modulations in the solar close magnetic flux, while the mass-loss rate is governed by the rather constant open magnetic flux. I derive a simple expression for stellar mass-loss rates as a function of the stellar ambient weak magnetic field, the stellar radius, the stellar escape velocity and the average height of the Alfvén surface. This expression predicts stellar mass-loss rates of 10-15 to 10-12 M⊙ yr-1 for Sun-like stars."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Presentation"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-10-28T17:04:10Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[],"dates":[{"date":"2013-10-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-10-28","titles":[{"title":"The Independence Of Stellar Mass-Loss Rates On Stellar Activity Based On Solar Observations"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7508","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:14:03Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7508","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Further, the reports on interviews with experts in the field highlight current perspectives on rights management and provide empirical support for the recommendations that have been put forward."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"report","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Report"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-10-30T16:37:52Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"blog archiving"},{"subject":"web archiving"},{"subject":"digital rights"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-10-29","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-10-29","titles":[{"title":"Blogforever D3.3: Development Of The Digital Rights Management Policy"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7518","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:13:32Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7518","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Ebenso präsent ist die Frage nach den Möglichkeiten der Bilder, einen zeitlichen und narrativen Ablauf darzustellen. Die umgekehrte Frage, die nach den Möglichkeiten der Sprache, zeitlichen Stillstand, Gleichzeitigkeit, den einzelnen Augenblick darzustellen, wird deutlich seltener gestellt. Genau dies soll hier getan werden, und zwar am Beispiel einer Epoche, in welcher dem Augenblick eine besondere Rolle zukommt. In der Tat wird im europäischen 18. Jahrhundert erstmals nicht mehr das kontinuierliche Fließen der Zeit betont, sondern ihre Fragmentierung in einzelne Augenblicke. Rückt der Augenblick ins Zentrum, stellt sich die Frage nach seinen Qualitäten und seiner Dauer, aber auch nach den Modalitäten seiner Darstellung. Georges Poulet war der Frage nach der „mesure de l’instant“ mit einem Ansatz nachgegangen, der philosophische und literarische Aspekte verband. Der vorliegende Beitrag möchte die Darstellung des Augenblicks aus einer intermedialen Perspektive in den Blick nehmen: Im Zusammenspiel von Malerei und Roman in der französischen Spätaufklärung."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":4,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"chapter","bibtex":"inbook","ris":"CHAP","resourceType":"Book section"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-11-05T15:23:00Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Enlightenment"},{"subject":"French Literature"},{"subject":"French Novel"},{"subject":"Eighteenth-Century"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-11-05","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-11-05","titles":[{"title":"‘La Mesure De L’Instant’ − Romanszene Und Malerei In Der Französischen Spätaufklärung"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7533","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:13:41Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7533","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Nevertheless, this testbed does not offer the ability to perform L2 experiments. To address this gap, we developed a platform that allows Community-Lab researchers to perform L2 experiments. Moreover, we decided to reach our goal using Software Defined Networking(SDN) techniques, due to the attention they received lately and their promise for a complete networking solution. Overall, we propose an architecture that allows researchers to perform L2 experiments in a generic community networks testbed.

Large enterprises nowadays may use hundreds or thousands of databases combined with different platforms on multiple physical servers. Because of improvements in hardware technology, especially the increase in the number of CPUs, servers are able to handle heavier workloads than before. A database may use only a fraction of the server hardware capacity, which can waste hardware resources. \n\nTo show the problem in reduced scale, Figure 1depicts 11 databases, each with its own application and server. A head DBA oversees a team of four DBAs, each of whom is responsible for two or three databases.\n\nOne possible solution to the problem is to consolidate data from multiple databases into one database on one computer which is known as database consolidation. Database consolidation is feasible by using new features proposed by Database 12c Release, i.e. Multi-tenant Environment and Pluggable Databases. Multi-tenant environment of Oracle, also, offers a path-breaking technology that delivers “Database as a service”. Database as a Service (DBaaS) is a paradigm where end users (DBAs, Developers, QA Engineers, Project Leads, etc.) can request database services, consume it for the lifetime of the project, and then have then automatically de-provisioned and returned to the resource pool.\n\nThe final goal of this project is to investigate and test the aforementioned features in practise. In the following chapters, we implemented a few test cases related to Pluggable Databases both in Oracle Enterprise Manager12c (EM12c) and SQL Plus environments. These use cases include topics related to users, manipulation of databases and database locations.  It is studied the paradigm to make a request for a “Database as a Service- DBaas” and the necessary steps are described combined with the possible alerts or problems faced and resolved.  In chapter 3.5, we have a presentation about the integration of Oracle VM Manager and Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c and a comparison is made between these two tools During this project, some scripts were developed to ease managing of both databases and related users. These support scripts are described in chapter 4."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"report","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Report"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-11-18T14:23:16Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[],"dates":[{"date":"2013-08-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-08-31","titles":[{"title":"Dbaas With Enterprise Manager"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7559","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/closedAccess","rights":"Closed Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:14:40Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7559","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Authors and readers are encouraged to understand not only the process, but also the rationale behind the process, which is closely connected with the peculiar challenges faced by the scientific problems (computational-science modelling under uncertainty, in broad and heterogeneous contexts) in the scope of the journal. \\(\\mathsf{\\Large\\text{The rationale behind the peer-review process}}\\) <strong>Computational research problems for more than one discipline. </strong>Research specific to a particular disciplinary domain is typically authored, and then studied, by experts in that domain. Several conventions, assumptions, fundamental protocols and methodology practices, are shared by domain experts as a common ground. Given that proficiency in these aspects is a precondition for domain experts, this kind of knowledge is often implicit, and not well communicated within domain-specific literature. \"Typical\" data preprocessing, model settings, quality-assessment assumptions (and their \"default\" simplifications and shortcuts), in this literature are often minimally reported or omitted, because the domain-specific community of researchers and practitioners knows them so well that they may resemble a sort of acquired conditioned response. However, when in a wider research more than one disciplinary domain is connected among each other, then implicit unexpressed knowledge may lead to ambiguity, misuse of results, and avoidable errors - sometimes challengly difficult to detect. The more and more diverse the domains, the higher this risk might be. <strong>Useful cross-domain building blocks. </strong>\"Transdisciplinary\" research may risk being misinterpreted as just the final summary list of results grabbed by autonomous disciplinary silos run in parallel. However, a poor ability to communicate computational methods and data - and their limitations - between multiple disciplinary domains would jeopardise the collective (cross-domain) ability to distill truly integrated computational science. Computational science for transdisciplinary problems requires a pragmatic, engineered, but reasonably simple and modular approach to break and connect disciplinary silos - when appropriate for the problems investigated. Publishing <em>useful</em> cross-domain building blocks of this approach is the aim of the peer-review process in NTMe. <strong>Connecting disciplines, space and time scales under uncertainty: the need for a shared semantics. </strong>Wide-scale transdisciplinary modelling (WSTM) relies on methods proper to computational science for connecting multiple scientific disciplines, and shedding light on broad, complex problems. Several of the most pressing problems we face as a human society are only partially known in their chain of consequences, and hopelessly difficult to address by a single discipline and a narrow perspective. Some of these problems capture the specific interest by particularly exposed regions, but their mechanism is more general, with essential knowledge often lying in other spatial areas - or even other time periods - hence calling for a wider perspective. Multiple spatial and temporal scales, with dissimilar data resolution, are frequent in WSTM problems, since they are often dictated by the complexity of reality and the available data. A wide-scale extent typically implies uneven quality and availability of data, and many sources of uncertainty - which increases when assumptions, methods and semantics by different disciplines or research institutions do not easily merge. A truly transdisciplinary communication of this essential semantics requires the <em>freedom </em>to communicate scientific knowledge, accurately and transparently, between disciplinary and corporate barriers. <strong>Real knowledge sharing in computational science. </strong>As a consequence, wide-scale transdisciplinary modelling demands a focus on reproducible research and real scientific knowledge freedom. Data and software freedom are essential aspects of knowledge freedom in computational science. Therefore, ideally published articles should also provide the readers with the data and source code of the described mathematical modelling. To maximise transparency, replicability, reproducibility and reusability, published data should be made available as open data while source code should be made available as free software. Communicating semantics even to non-experts in a given domain requires that mathematical assumptions, otherwise obvious within a specific discipline, are duly annotated in a portable and concise way. Accordingly, brief but semantically clear documentation of data, methods and software is a key precondition. Here, a two-stage peer review process is described in which scientific knowledge freedom is considered with a dedicated Eligibility Access Review. This new peer review process is applied by <em>Notes on Transdisciplinary Modelling for Environment</em> with a focus on WSTM for environment. \\(\\mathsf{\\Large\\text{The peer-review process}}\\) <strong>A two-stage peer review process to avoid single-use disposable computational science. </strong>The two-stage peer review process requires discussion papers to be published so as to receive feedback from the scientific community before their possible finalisation. Initial manuscript submission is subject to the soundness review outlined above, also ensuring eligibility criteria to be fulfilled so as to support scientific knowledge freedom. Although this concept is multifaceted, some few dimensions might be emphasised which broadly apply in computational science and engineering (CSE). Among the many possible eligibility criteria in CSE, it should be highlighted at least the need for: free software to have been published so as for it to be persistently available; appropriate licensing and source code review to have been done (portable modularisation, with semantics of mathematical data-transformation methods clearly annotated); free data to have been published so as for it to be persistently available (with semantics of quantities clearly annotated); a minimal share of free-access core references to be selected in order for scientists and research organisations not to be discriminated on the basis of their funding availability, when they try to access the core literature cited in the manuscript. Before acceptance for discussion, a manuscript (and its potential data, parameters and software) may be revised, without exposing to the public immature versions, until it becomes able to fulfil the eligibility criteria. These iterations between author(s) and editors/reviewers remain confidential, and a potential manuscript rejection does not preclude resubmission. Acceptance of the manuscript to the discussion stage is followed by the permanent publication of the accepted version. This does not preclude, and actually encourages, further revised versions to be resubmitted. Any new revision is subject to eligibility access review, which takes into account the submission history of the manuscript and the already accepted public older versions. <strong>Not a static publication. </strong>The discussion stage of the peer review process allows short comments to be submitted by referees and the scientific community, while authors are encouraged to interact with pending comments by providing their responses. During this stage, the paper accepted for discussion is already citable. Depending on the specific goals of each research problem, the discussion may remain open for a short time interval, or instead for a noticeably longer period of time (even indefinitely, if appropriate: for example, whenever authors do consider publishing cumulative milestone versions as important). There is not an a-priori limit to the duration of this first stage, and to the number of intermediate public revisions (which are optional), for a paper accepted for discussion. The second stage of peer review concludes the discussion stage with the submission of a revised manuscript, with final review and corrections. Fulfilment of the eligibility criteria is required over all the publication stages.<br> The published materials might be updated from time to time (at the authors' discretion), and - after peer-reviewing the changes - published so that the evolution is clear and available to others. Although preferred and encouraged in the discussion stage, updates are possible even after the final stage. Revisions offering a noticeably different content, compared with the previous versions, might sometime be recommended by editors/reviewers as deserving the status of a new publication - not to confuse the readers. This implies the full two-stage review process has to be applied to the new publication (as an independent publication), while the previous accepted publication is considered as the final permanent version. Recalling an analogy with the typical evolution of free-software, a software package is frequently subject to future improvements and corresponding new versions. If a new version is too different from the original package, it may become a new independent package. <strong>Scientific opinions, perspectives, and overviews.</strong> Manuscripts focusing on computational science methods, data, parameters, and software are expected to contribute practical components of scientific knowledge which can be adapted, modified, or generally integrated within the future body of knowledge - potentially in unexpected ways. Therefore, the aforementioned two-stage review is, overall, meant to ease the future invention of derivative works. On the other hand, manuscripts offering expert opinions on these topics do not contribute \"practical\" components to be directly modified. Instead, they contribute organised ideas to support the evolution of scientific knowledge. Therefore, the peer review process for this typology of manuscripts focuses on: the broad understandability and potential interest of the expert opinions, and the factual correctness of the objective elements included in the opinion (with adequate bibliographic, tabular, visual support where appropriate). <strong>Preregistration, protocols and methods. </strong>NTMe accepts a third typology of manuscripts, focusing on anticipated results (hence not yet computed) which are expected following a modelling procedure to transform input data and parameters into the desired output. As data and software are only anticipated in this typology of manuscripts, the peer-review process focuses on: the broad understandability and potential interest of the proposed protocol or methodology, the correctness and clarity of the mathematical formulation of the proposed computational-modelling steps (data-transformation modules), the discussion of anticipated results, pitfalls, sources of uncertainty and their proper management, bifurcations of the methodology depending on the potential variants that a user may desire to apply (depending on available data and their quality, and on the desired specialisation of the proposed general method), and the adequacy of bibliographic, tabular, visual supports where appropriate. <strong>Abstract, and plain language summary. </strong>Each article includes a technical abstract. Although the topics of published content might deal with domain-specific aspects of computational/environmental science, their focused analysis is expected to support wider research in a transdisciplinary context. Therefore, the abstract is expected to be accessible beyond the domain-specific research community. Each article, either in the discussion or in the final stage, in addition to a technical abstract needs a <em>plain language summary</em> so that non-experts and readers with a basic scientific and technical literacy can understand the main contributions of the article. The aim of the plain language summary is to support educational dissemination. The summary is not a simpler abstract, and typically offers a longer, more comprehensive description. It is realised with an editorial support to authors, so as to respect a general structure (unless otherwise agreed): first, the general context of the work is presented (the general topics in which the work is situated); second, the general open questions are introduced to which the work aims to contribute; third, the specific way is described in which the work contributes to progress on the general open questions; fourth, the implications, new opportunities or suggested lines of research, and potential limitations and unaswered questions are summarised. <strong>Constructive peer review.</strong> The ultimate aim of the peer review process is to support authors, and future readers, in sharing useful, durable, and understandable notes of transdisciplinary knowledge. Given the very nature of the topics in NTMe, the need for a cogent peer review on a multiplicity of expertise fields is essential. Rarely a single reviewer is able to cover all the aspects of transdiciplinary computational science. Even so, different opinions by different reviewers may emerge on specific points. Therefore, a <em>constructive </em>approach is promoted during each step of the peer review process, so that authors are guided to understand the peer review, and a compendium of recommandations may be presented in a consistent way. <sup>© 2012-2020 Daniele de Rigo.

Participatory and collaborative content production has largely replaced the traditional ways of information sharing and make up a large share of the daily information consumed by web users.\n\nThe main properties of user generated content are a low publication threshold and little or no editorial control. While this has positively affected the variety and timeliness of the available information, it causes an even higher variance in quality than the already heterogeneous quality of traditional web content.\n\nIn this project, we focus on the quality of collaboratively created texts. Using the example of Wikipedia, we investigate how the quality of articles can be assessed automatically and how we can apply language technology to facilitate quality assurance on a large scale.\n\n \n\nIn a first scenario, we analyze two corpora of Wikipedia article discussion pages extracted from the English Wikipedia and the Simple English Wikipedia, which we manually annotated with quality-directed speech act labels. We show how these corpora can be used to automatically identify the problems and solutions discussed by the community. We finally discuss possibilities how this approach can help to improve work coordination in Wikipedia and ultimately improve the quality assurance process.\n\n \n\nIn a second scenario, we focus on analyzing the article quality directly. Instead of applying abstract quality scores to each article, we approach the problem from a different direction and aim to identify concrete quality problems. Wikipedia already provides a rich set of quality flaw markers, which we extract on a large scale and use as training data for automatic quality flaw prediction, which can assist authors in improving the quality of their articles. In this context, we furthermore analyze the topic prevalence of individual flaw types, i.e. the phenomenon that particular flaws appear more often in articles from certain topics.

In particular, these configurations are a powerful cue to a three dimensional object reconstruction because their two dimensional projection remains viewpoint-invariant. While a large body of literature has demonstrated sensitivity to changes in these so-called non-accidental configurations, it remains unclear what information is used in establishing such sensitivity. In this study, we explored a possibility that non-accidental configurations can already be inferred from the basic constituents of objects, namely, their edges. We constructed a set of stimuli composed of two lines corresponding to various non-accidental properties and configuration of geons, including collinearity, alignment, curvature of contours, curvature of configuration axis, expansion, cotermination, and junction type. Using a simple visual search paradigm, we demonstrated that participants were faster at detecting targets that differed from distractors in a non-accidental configuration than in a metric one. Given that such sensitivity emerged from a configuration of only two lines, our results open a possibility that non-accidental configurations could be encoded at the earliest stages of the visual information processing."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Poster"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2013-12-10T10:38:40Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"non-accidental properties"},{"subject":"visual perception"},{"subject":"perceptual organization"},{"subject":"psychophysics"},{"subject":"regularity"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-12-10","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-12-10","titles":[{"title":"Sensitivity To Nonaccidental Configurations Of Twoline Stimuli"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7610","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:16:48Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7610","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

We propose the following conceptual framework: (i) alternating steps of feature detection and feature pooling (grouping) in a hierarchical manner; (ii) segmentation into (provisional) objects by an unsupervised learning procedure using the computed feature grouping strengths. We present an initial implementation of this model where grouping principles such as proximity or good continuation are leveraged to discover grouped objects in an image.

This circumstance can arise, for example, from missing documentation. Application-level monitoring, e.g., provided by Kieker, can help with the comprehension of such internal behavior.

In the cloud, such processing requires scaling by the number of instances.\n\nIn this paper, we present our performance tunings conducted on the basis of the Kieker monitoring framework to support high-throughput and live analysis of application-level traces.

In an earlier neuropsychological study Conci et al. [2009, Neuropsychologia, 47, 726-732] showed that low-level collinear contour facilitation and high-level surface filling-in both contribute separately to a reduction in extinction in patients with visual neglect when viewing Kanizsa stimuli. Since Wang et al. (2012) did not include control conditions similar to Conci et al. (2009), it is not clear whether the Kanizsa triangle broke through suppression due to collinear contour facilitation or higher-level surface completion mechanisms [Kogo et al., 2010, Psychological Review, 117(2), 406-439]. In this study, we compared suppression times of regular and random versions of a Kanizsa square, a cross stimulus (allowing collinear contour facilitation but no surface completion) and a surface stimulus (allowing surface completion but no collinear contour facilitation). Our results suggest that neither collinear contour facilitation nor surface completion mechanisms play a primary role in determining suppression times.

Originally viewed as an immune-privileged organ, the central nervous system (CNS) is now recognized to have a constant interplay with the innate and the adaptive immune systems, where resident microglia and infiltrating immune cells from the periphery have important roles. Common diseases of the CNS, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), and neurodegeneration, elicit a neuroinflammatory response with the goal to limit the extent of the disease and to support repair and regeneration. However, various disease mechanisms lead to neuroinflammation (NI) contributing to the disease process itself. Molecular imaging is the method of choice to try to decipher key aspects of the dynamic interplay of various inducers, sensors, transducers, and effectors of the orchestrated inflammatory response in vivo in animal models and patients.

In recent years, several new PET radioligands for TSPO have been evaluated in disease models. [18F]DPA-714 is a TSPO radiotracer with great promise; however results vary between different experimental models of neuroinflammation. To further examine the potential of [18F]DPA-714, it was compared directly to [11C]PK11195 in experimental cerebral ischaemia in rats. <strong>Methods:</strong> Under anaesthesia, the middle cerebral artery of adult rats was occluded for 60 min using the filament model. Rats were allowed recovery for 5 to 7 days before one hour dynamic PET scans with [11C]PK11195 and/or [18F]DPA-714 under anaesthesia. <strong>Results:</strong> Uptake of [11C]PK11195 vs [18F]DPA-714 in the ischemic lesion was similar (core/contralateral ratio: 2.8460.67 vs 2.2860.34 respectively), but severity of the brain ischemia and hence ligand uptake in the lesion appeared to vary greatly between animals scanned with [11C]PK11195 or with [18F]DPA-714. To solve this issue of inter-individual variability, we performed a direct comparison of [11C]PK11195 and [18F]DPA-714 by scanning the same animals sequentially with both tracers within 24 h. In this direct comparison, the core/contralateral ratio (3.3561.21 vs 4.6662.50 for [11C]PK11195 vs [18F]DPA-714 respectively) showed a significantly better signal-to-noise ratio (1.6 (1.3–1.9, 95%CI) fold by linear regression) for [18F]DPA-714. <strong>Conclusions:</strong> In a clinically relevant model of neuroinflammation, uptake for both radiotracers appeared to be similar at first, but a high variability was observed in our model. Therefore, to truly compare tracers in such models, we performed scans with both tracers in the same animals. By doing so, our result demonstrated that [18F]DPA-714 displayed a higher signal-tonoise ratio than [11C]PK11195. Our results suggest that, with the longer half-life of [18F] which facilitates distribution of the tracer across PET centre, [18F]DPA-714 is a good alternative for TSPO imaging."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-3","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-01-08T11:55:00Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"cerebral ischemia"},{"subject":"immunohistochemistry techniques"},{"subject":"lesions"},{"subject":"magnetic resonance imaging"},{"subject":"neuroimaging"},{"subject":"positron emission tomography"},{"subject":"signal to noise ratio"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-13","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-13","titles":[{"title":"[18F]DPA-714: Direct Comparison with [11C]PK11195 in a Model of Cerebral Ischemia in Rats"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"http://zenodo.org/record/7650","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"},{"rightsIdentifierScheme":"SPDX","rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","schemeUri":"https://spdx.org/licenses/","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","rightsIdentifier":"cc-by-4.0"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"ZENODO","contentUrl":[],"contributors":[{"affiliation":[],"name":"European Commission","nameIdentifiers":[{"nameIdentifierScheme":"info","nameIdentifier":"info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/278850"}],"contributorType":"Funder"}],"updated":"2020-10-10T08:48:57Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7650","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

In this study, we evaluated neuroinflammation in ALS patients using a radioligand of TSPO, 18F-DPA-714. Ten patients with probable or definite ALS (all right-handed, without dementia, and untreated by riluzole or other medication that might bias the binding on the TSPO), were enrolled prospectively and eight healthy controls matched for age underwent a PET study. Comparison of the distribution volume ratios between both groups were performed using a Mann-Whitney’s test. Significant increase of distribution of volume ratios values corresponding to microglial activation was found in the ALS sample in primary motor, supplementary motor and temporal cortex (p = 0.009, p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively).

We hypothesized that the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain of APP/presenilin 1 mice leads to higher diffusion kurtosis measures due to increased microstructural complexity. As such, our purpose was to provide an in vivo proof of principle for detection of amyloidosis by diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). <strong>Methods: </strong>APPKM670/671NL/presenilin 1 L166P mice (n.5) and wild-type littermates (n.5) underwent DKI at the age of 16 months. Averaged diffusion and diffusion kurtosis parameters were obtained for multiple regions (hippocampus–cortex–thalamus– cerebellum). After DKI, mice were sacrificed for amyloid staining. <strong>Results:</strong> Histograms of the frequency distribution of the DKI parameters tended to shift to higher values. After normalization of absolute values to the cerebellum, a nearly plaque-free region, mean, radial, and axial diffusion kurtosis were significantly higher in APP/presenilin 1 mice as compared to wild type in the cortex and thalamus, regions demonstrating substantial amyloid staining. <strong>Conclusion: </strong>The current study, although small-scale, suggests increased DKI metrics, in the absence of alterations in diffusion tensor imaging metrics in the cortex and thalamus of APP/presenilin 1 mice with established amyloidosis. These results warrant further investigations on the potential of DKI as a sensitive marker for Alzheimer’s disease."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-3","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":1,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-01-08T12:42:18Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"diffusion kurtosis imaging"},{"subject":"mouse model"},{"subject":"Alzheimer’s disease"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-11","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-11","titles":[{"title":"Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging to Detect Amyloidosis in an APP/PS1 Mouse Model for Alzheimer’s Disease"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"http://zenodo.org/record/7652","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"},{"rightsIdentifierScheme":"SPDX","rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","schemeUri":"https://spdx.org/licenses/","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","rightsIdentifier":"cc-by-4.0"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"ZENODO","contentUrl":[],"contributors":[{"affiliation":[],"name":"European Commission","nameIdentifiers":[{"nameIdentifierScheme":"info","nameIdentifier":"info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/278850"}],"contributorType":"Funder"}],"updated":"2020-10-10T08:48:49Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7652","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Although the cuprizone mouse model allowed elucidation of many molecular factors governing remyelination, currently very little is known about the spatial origin of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells that initiate remyelination in this model. Therefore, we here investigated in this model whether subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) contribute to remyelination of the splenium following cuprizone-induced demyelination. Experimentally, from the day of in situ NSPC labeling, C57BL/6J mice were fed a 0.2% cuprizone diet during a 4-week period and then left to recover on a normal diet for 8 weeks. Two in situ labeling strategies were employed: (i) NSPCs were labeled by intraventricular injection of micron-sized iron oxide particles and then followed up longitudinally by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (ii) SVZ NSPCs were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the eGFP and Luciferase reporter proteins for longitudinal monitoring by means of in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In contrast to preceding suggestions, no migration of SVZ NSPC towards the demyelinated splenium was observed using both MRI and BLI, and further validated by histological analysis, thereby demonstrating that SVZ NSPCs are unable to contribute directly to remyelination of the splenium in the cuprizone model. Interestingly, using longitudinal BLI analysis and confirmed by histological analysis, an increased migration of SVZ NSPC-derived neuroblasts towards the olfactory bulb was observed following cuprizone treatment, indicative for a potential link between CNS inflammation and increased neurogenesis."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-3","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-01-21T09:59:54Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[],"dates":[{"date":"2013-08-07","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-08-07","titles":[{"title":"Multimodal imaging of subventricular zone neural stem/progenitor cells in the cuprizone mouse model reveals increased neurogenic potential for the olfactory bulb pathway, but no contribution to remyelination of the corpus callosum"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"http://zenodo.org/record/7684","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"},{"rightsIdentifierScheme":"SPDX","rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","schemeUri":"https://spdx.org/licenses/","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","rightsIdentifier":"cc-by-4.0"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"ZENODO","contentUrl":[],"contributors":[{"affiliation":[],"name":"European Commission","nameIdentifiers":[{"nameIdentifierScheme":"info","nameIdentifier":"info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/278850"}],"contributorType":"Funder"}],"updated":"2020-10-10T08:55:37Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7684","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Nevertheless, most of the transplanted cells die within the first hours after transplantation and induce a neuroinflammatory response. In order to increase the efficacy of MSC transplantation, it is thus imperative to completely characterise the mechanisms mediating neuroinflammation and cell death following MSC transplantation into the CNS.

However research into neural differences associated with skill in visual art is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there would be any differences in brain structure in relation to increasing representational drawing skill in a diverse group of training artists. The relationship between brain structure and drawing skill was then examined in relation to local perceptual processing abilities in order to explore existing behavioral evidence that local processing facilitates drawing ability (Drake &amp; Winner, 2011; Chamberlain et al, 2013). A cohort of graduate and post-graduate art students and non-art students completed drawing tasks, the embedded figures task and the block design task. Scores on these tasks were then correlated with the regional grey and white matter volume in cortical and subcortical structures. An increase in grey matter density in the cerebellum was observed in relation to observational drawing ability which was independent of artistic training, suggesting an enhancement of fine motor control and procedural memory. Furthermore, overlap in medial frontal regions associated with performance on local processing tasks and drawing suggest that drawing may be facilitated by the suppression of bias toward global perceptual processing in action selection. The findings corroborate small-scale fMRI studies of online drawing and provide insights into the properties of the developing artistic brain."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Poster"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-01-22T13:02:03Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Voxel-based morphometry, drawing, local processing, cerebellum"}],"dates":[{"date":"2014-01-22","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2014-01-22","titles":[{"title":"Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study Of Individual Differences In Drawing And Local Processing Ability"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7690","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2014,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:11Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7690","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The average age of dialysis initiation was 50±10.2 years. The most common comorbidity was systemic hypertension (66.7%). Liver cyst was the main extra-renal manifestation (10.4%). Twenty-five percent of the patients required renal transplantation, and (22.9%) undergone nephrectomy. The most widely used classes of antihypertensive drugs were β-blockers (41.7%) and drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system (31.3%), while 56.3% of patients were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.\n\n<br>\nConclusions: This is a pioneering epidemiological study in Northwestern Paraná state.

The goals of treatment are to create normal anatomy of the proximal femur and acetabulum and then to maintain that anatomy to allow normal development of hip. Our aim was to identify significance of the test of stability in planning of appropriate osteotomy during open reduction in order to achieve stable concentric reduction in DDH in terms of Severin’s clinical and radiological outcome. Materials and Methods: In this study, 50 children with DDH, which required open reduction and osteotomy for stable concentric reduction, were admitted in Orthopaedic department of SIMS/Services Hospital from Mar 2004 - May 2008. Clinical assessment and radiograph of pelvis with both hips in anteroposterior view was done for all the patients to confirm the diagnosis. After the confirmation of diagnosis surgery was planned and during surgery test of stability applied. Test of stability are the maneuvers which included flexion, internal rotation and abduction performed by the operating surgeon to assess the need for a concomitant osteotomy. If hip found stable in internal rotation and abduction, varus derotational femoral ostetomy was done and fixed with 1/3rd tubular plate. If hip required flexion it was treated with innominate osteotomy and fixed with K-wires. Those hips which required flexion, abduction and internal rotation for concentric reduction were treated with both ostetomies and fixed with K-wire &amp; plate. Postoperatively all the patients were applied hip spica. A descriptive and analytical statistical analysis was performed on SPSS, version 13. Results: The mean age of patients was 4 years (Mean ± SD: 4 ± 1.31), youngest patient being 3 years of age and oldest 7 years. Sex distribution with female to male ratio was 1.8:1. On an average follow up of 3.2 years Severin’s clinical outcome for 42 (84%) patients was excellent, 7 (14%) was good and 1 (2%) was poor. P-value was 0.001. Severin’s radiological outcome for 40 (80%) patients was excellent and for 10 (20%) patients was good. P value was 0.112.

Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract pathogens has increased worldwide. Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently recommended that each hospital should determine the locally establish mechanisms to resistance rates among uropathogens. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the bacterial agents that cause urinary tract infection both in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients and to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern against various types of antimicrobial agents used for treating urinary tract infections. Materials and Methods: We carried out a prospective study of urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing from symptomatic outpatients and inpatients. Results: A total 150 cases were positive for significant bacteria, out of which 83 (55.4%) were from out patients and 67 (44.6%) were from hospitalized patients. The majority of the bacteria were isolated from female (78.7%) while the remaining was from male (21.3%). In the present study Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen for UTI in both the groups. Klebsiella sps was the second common organism in hospital acquired infection followed by Pseudomonas. sps. Analysis of the frequency of bacterial isolates according to the age of the patients revealed that Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections were more prevalent in the age groups (&gt;20-49 years) and Pseudomonas infections were more prevalent in children and the elderly (&lt;20 years and &gt;50 years, respectively) and Salmonella typhi were isolated from elderly (&gt;60 years age) patient from community–acquired infection. The mean susceptibility was high for Imipenem (98.8%), Amikacin (53.2%), Gentamicin (52.3%) and Ciprofloxacin (50.5%) but low for Ampicillin (34.2%), Norfloxacin (40.4%), Nitrofurantoin (44.5%), and Cotrimoxazole (46.7%).

The results of confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that, after two hours of coincubation of cells loaded with Calcein AM and Dil according to Goldberg et al. and unlabelled cells, the cytoplasmic dye Calcein AM was actively transferred to unlabelled cells through newly formed gap junctions. This transfer could be almost completely blocked by addition of 60 μg/ml of anti-E2Cx43 antibodies. Flow cytometric analysis showed that, in experiments carried out according to Goldberg et al., with approximately 2% of labeled cells added to unlabelled ones, about 2.5% of the total cell population took up Calcein AM through gap junctions, thus forming a cell pool characterized by low-intensity green fluorescence. In the presence of antibodies, the proportion of these cells was no more than 0.6%, which indicates an at least fourfold suppression of the gap junction function by E2Cx43 antibodies. The data obtained were reproduced in several independent series. Thus, we obtained monoclonal antibodies capable of modulating the gap junction function in cultures of Cx43-positive cells."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T06:59:36Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Gap-junction;"},{"subject":"connexin-43;"},{"subject":"extracellular loop;"},{"subject":"monoclonal antibodies"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-04-14","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-04-14","titles":[{"title":"Downregulation Of Gap Junctions In Astrocytes By Monoclonal Antibodies Against The Second Extracellular Loop Of Connexin-43"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7758","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:10Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7758","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Thirty-two (32) albino rats were divided equally into 4 groups. Groups A and B which served as normal (NC) and diabetic (DC) controls respectively, received placebo treatment. The diabetic test groups C and D were respectively treated with combined extracts of VA and GL (200mg/kg b. w., p. o.) and insulin, (humulin 5 IU/kg, s.c.) for 28 days. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and blood and pancreas were collected for serum glucose and histological evaluation, respectively. Changes in animal weight were also measured within the period. From the results it was revealed that both the combined extracts and humulin significantly increased the animals’ body weight (p&lt;0.05) from -10.5% reduction in the DC, to 7.6% and 8.9% respectively. In the same order, serum glucose significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) by 12.49% and 14.96% after the 28-day treatment compared to DC. The extent of reversal of hyperglycemia in the extract treated animals compared well with the insulin treated group. The biochemical results were corroborated with results of histological evaluations: The pancreatic β-cells of DC animals which were distorted and degenerated with shrunken cell mass as against prominent islet cells with normal exocrine pancreas of NC animals became rapidly proliferated upon intervention with the combined extracts, suggesting a possible regeneration of the islet cells. On the otherhand, intervention with humulin did not produce observable differences in the cyto-architecture of the pancreatic islets compared to the diabetic control, confirming an extra-pancreatic mechanism of insulin."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T07:00:14Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Diabetes mellitus"},{"subject":"V. amygdalina"},{"subject":"G. latifolium"},{"subject":"human insulin,"},{"subject":"pancreas β-cells regeneration"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-04-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-04-28","titles":[{"title":"Effect Of Combined Leaf Extracts Of Vernonia Amygdalina (Bitter Leaf) And Gongronema Latifolium (Utazi) On The Pancreatic Beta-Cells Of Streptozotocin- Induced Diabetic Rats"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7759","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:10Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7759","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

We are hereby introducing our new journal, named as “British Journal of Medicine and Medical Research (BJMMR)” BJMMR is a complete open access, purely online, general medical journal, dedicated to publish medical and medicine research from all disciplines and therapeutic areas. BJMMR is not meant to add just another name in the already populated list of medical journals. In order to synchronize with the very fast paced demand of world medical community, BJMMR is characterized with many unique concepts and policies. BJMMR is a combination of many great peculiarities as the eternal free access, world wide indexation, fast appearance, wide area of fields covered, top class Reviewers engaged, international outreach with no bias to the developed or developing countries representatives, etc. We respect the truth that “Change is the only Constant”. We promise to all medical community that for the sake of science, for providing better service to authors and readers, we will change/evolve our policies with a justified logic. Please be sure that “We are not ‘Constant’, we are changing and changing for YOU”. Our publishing procedures are bolstered by state-of-the-art ‘RUNNING ISSUE’ concept - which gives the benefit of ‘ZERO WAITING TIME’ for officially accepted papers. Authors have not to wait for next forthcoming issue to get their officially accepted manuscript to be published. We understand that many times it becomes very painful for the authors to wait to see the published version of their paper, even though it has been accepted long time back. BJMMR will not only publish traditional full research reports, including short communications, but also this journal will publish reports/articles on all stages of the research process like study protocols, pilot studies and pre-protocols. BJMMR is novelty attracting, open minded, peer-reviewed medical periodical, designed to serve as a perfectly new platform for both mainstream and \"new ground shaking\" works as long as they are technically correct and scientifically motivated. As a part of social responsibility to promote ‘young scientists’ (like PhD students, post doctoral students, etc), BJMMR is dedicated to extend all possible helping hand. It is the promise of ‘team-BJMMR’ that any technical/financial constrain will not be a limitation for any excellent paper to be published in BJMMR. I hope many uniquely designed policies of BJMMR, like “RUNNING ISSUE”, etc. will be handy for the ‘Young Scientist’ community. As a part of our promise to provide best service to medical community, we have introduced state-of-theart “SUBCENTRAL” platform, where starting from manuscript submission, manuscript number generation, peer review, revision, payment, invoicing, publication, etc formalities are automated. Hope all these initiatives will open 24X7 service window as well as will augment transparent and fast process compared to traditional system. We are also having many other, cutting-edge technologies and policies/awards like “Research Promotion Program for Developing Countries (RP2DC)”, “Reviewer Editor Recognition Program (RERP)”, and “Established Author Recognition Program (EARP)”, “SCIENCEDOMAIN international Excellence Award” etc. I hope that if you keep an attentive eye in our website, you will discover many attractive policies. In a broad sense the purpose of this journal is: to help a wide variety of institutions to understand, track and better manage their own progress with the progress of world medical community. Many good technical journals already exist in related fields. This is not another technical journal. Instead, BJMMR will provide reviews by recognized experts across the breadth of related issues, perspective pieces and many other services to help the medical community to move forward. BJMMR tweets you to ‘follow us’ in coming issues to see many more changes and surprises, waiting for you. We welcome you. Prof. D. A.

It is noteworthy to mention that India already accounts for about 9.5% of the total 1.2 million fatal accidents in the world. In 2009, for every 4.14 minute and 1.13 minute one death and one injury took place in India from road accident, respectively. Between 1970 and 2009 the number of accidents has quadrupled (1.1 lakh in 1970 to 4.22 lakh in 2009) with nearly 6.5 fold increase in injuries (0.7 lakh in 1970 to 4.67 lakh in 2009) and nearly 9.5 fold increase in fatalities (0.14 lakh in 1970 to 1.27 lakh in 2009). During the period of 2004 to 2009, road accident rate, injury rate and casualty rate per 105 population have been increased by 8.5%, 4.7% and 29.8%, respectively. In 2009, total 1,08,409 male and 18,487 female died in road accident. It was also observed that in last five years (2005 to 2009) average 84.9% male and 15.1 % female died in road accident. In 2009, total 90,298 people, out of total 1,26,896 accident victims died from age group of (5-44 Yrs), which is the most productive age group for nation. Average percentage share of last five years (2005-2009) for the age groups (Up to 14 Yrs), (15–29 Yrs), (30–44 Yrs), (45–59 Yrs), and (Above 60 Yrs) were 6.35, 29.84, 35.05, 20.97 and 7.79, respectively. The month-wise distribution of ‘Road Accidents’ has also shown more accidents during May (38,928) and June (36,234) sharing 9.2% and 8.6% respectively. Maximum ‘Road Accidents’ (68,835) were reported during 3 p.m. to 6 p.m (16.3%), 64,191 cases during 9 a.m. to 12 noon (15.2%), and least number (28,984) of these accidents (6.9%) was reported during 1200 to 3 AM in the night.

Materials and Methods: A prospective review of patients with bilateral benign multinodular goiter undergoing subtotal thyroidectomy (Group 1), and near-total thyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy (Group 2) during 5-year period was undertaken. Patients’ demographics, indications for surgery, type of operation performed, final histological diagnosis and complications were recorded.

Core binding factors (CBF) are heterodimeric transcription factors containing a DNA binding Runx 1, Runx 2, or Runx 3 subunit, along with a non DNA binding CBF subunit. All four subunits are required at one or more stages of hematopoiesis. This review describes the role of Runx1 and CBF in the initiation of hematopoiesis in the embryo, and in the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells. The core site in the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Moloney MLV) enhancer was previously shown to be an important determinant of the T-cell disease specificity of the virus. Mutation of the core site resulted in a significant shift in disease specificity of the Moloney virus from T-cell leukemia to erythro-leukemia. It has been shown that a protein that binds the core site, one of the core-binding factors is highly expressed in thymus and is essential for hematopoiesis in stem cells. Earlier studies suggest that CBF plays a critical role in mediating pathogenesis of Moloney MLV in vivo. Spontaneous leukemia was not observed either upon CBF expression, consistent with a model in which the increase in HSC and progenitor populations represents a pre-leukemic state, and additional mutations are required for progression to leukemia."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T07:07:11Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Leukemia;"},{"subject":"core binding factor;"},{"subject":"stem cell;"},{"subject":"methylation;"},{"subject":"hematopoiesis;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-07-18","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-07-18","titles":[{"title":"Influence Of Dna Methylation And Core Binding Factors In Expression Of Leukemia Virus In Hemapoietic Stem Cells"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7767","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:11Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7767","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Surgery has proven to be the most effective long-term treatment for sustained weight loss and improvement of comorbidities in morbidly obese patients. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a relatively new procedure for weight loss with lower surgical risks, which is particularly suitable for those patients at highest risk for surgery, either because of their comorbidities or their weight. LSG is being explored as a viable surgical option for treating morbid obesity, after simply being considered the first step of a staged procedure in super-obese/high-risk patients to allow some weight loss before a laparoscopic Roux-en- Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion-duodenal switch procedure. With the revelation that patients experience safe weight loss after LSG, interest in using this procedure as a bridge to more definite surgical procedures has risen. Outright reported benefits of LSG include the low rates of complications, the avoidance of foreign material, the maintenance of normal gastro-intestinal continuity, the absence of malabsorption, and the reduction of gherlin producing mass, accounting for its superiority to other restrictive bariatric surgical procedures. Although early results after LSG are promising in terms of short-term weight loss, more studies are required to evaluate the long-term durability of LSG especially effective weight loss, maintenance of weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities, and the potential of gastric tube dilatation with weight regain."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T07:07:47Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Morbid obesity;"},{"subject":"laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy;"},{"subject":"bariatric restrictive surgical procedure;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-06-30","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-06-30","titles":[{"title":"Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy For Morbid Obesity: The Future Of Bariatric Surgery?"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7768","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:11Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7768","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

After 30 min, the animals were each administered orally with 40% (w/v) glucose at a dose of 1ml /100 g bwt. Blood glucose levels were then monitored at 30, 60, and 120 min. intervals and reported as the average glucose level of each group. Another set of twenty five rats (diabetic rats) were randomly distributed into five groups of five animals each while the additional sixth group was the positive control consisting of five normal rats. Treatments were as follows: Group I, diabetic treated with A. vogelli at a dose of 500 mg/kg bwt; Group II, diabetic treated with P. curatellifolia at a dose of 500 mg/kg bwt; Group III, diabetic treated with glibenclamide 600μg /kg bwt; Group IV, diabetic treated with mixture of Parinari curatellifolia and A. vogelli (1:1) (500 mg/kg bwt); Group V, diabetic untreated (control negative) while group VI was the positive control. Results: A significant reduction in postprandial sugar level was observed after 30 min in all treatments. The extracts individually and in combined form also showed effective decrease in plasma glucose levels on the diabetic rats. There were significant reductions (p&lt;0.05) in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in high density lipoprotein (HDL)–cholesterol in the treated diabetic group compared to the negative control. Furthermore, significant reductions in aspartate aminotransferases (AST) and alanine aminotransferases (ALT) levels were observed in the treated diabetic animals compared to the untreated.

Design: Sixty postmenopausal teachers with 45-60 years old participated in a clinical trial conducted in an academic center in Gorgan-Iran. The participants divided in two equal groups randomly and treated with Vitex or placebo, 40 drops per day for 8 weeks. Data collected by using interview, individual characteristics questionnaire and evaluated by Blatt-kapperman’s index at four follow-up visits. Statistical analysis was carried out by using descriptive statistics and multivariable analysis. Results: The difference in frequency of hot flushes between groups was significant at 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th weeks of intervention (P=0.015, p=0.000, p=0.000 and p=0.000, respectively) and also the decline in the severity of hot flashes in women who received Vitex was more evident on 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th weeks (p=0.015, p=0.12, p=0.000 and p=0.000, respectively). Furthermore, comparing both study groups the result showed that the difference in Blatt-Kupperman index was not significant on the 2nd week of treatment (p=0.198); however, it was statistically significant between the two groups on the 4th, 6th, and 8th week of treatment (p=0.008, p=0.00 and p=0.00, respectively). Some adverse events recoded between groups were statistically significant (p=0.012).

Material &amp; Methods: In a retrospective analysis of 244 patients, result of PCR, gender, fatty liver, diabetes, abnormal ALT at start and end of treatment were the qualitative variables. Age, weight, ALT at start and end of treatment, hemoglobin, platelets and WBC at start of treatment were quantitative variables. Bivariate, multivariate analysis and odds ratio were computed to verify statistically significant association with relapse rate by running binary logistic regression model. Results: Out of total 244 patients there were 54.1% male and 45.9% female. Eighty two (33.6%) patients had weight &gt; 70 Kg, 30 (12.3%) had fatty liver, 18 were (7.4%) diabetic, 12 (4.9%) had normal ALT at start of therapy and 140 (57.4%) had abnormal ALT at the end. Eighty four (34.4%) patients relapsed while 160 (65.6%) maintained SVR after 6 month to 2 years of completion. In bivariate analysis, age, weight, fatty liver, high fever, decrease and increase in Hb were found significant. The binary logistic regression revealed the significant association of weight (OR=84.813; p=0.000), high fever (OR=4.478; p= 0.038) and Hb increase at 1st month (OR=0.037; p=0.013) with relapse rate. Nagelkerke R Square and Cox &amp; Snell R Square statistics explained 71.1% and 51.1% variation in the model respectively and 93.1% area under the curve gave it very good prediction strength. Conclusion: The relapse rate to conventional interferon and ribavirin treatment is high in Pakistan. The assessment of predictors of response, like body weight may help in individualizing the treatment, patient selection and to decrease an ever expanding pool of non-responders and re-lapsers.

Down syndrome screening has been an integral part of routine prenatal care in recent decades. Currently, there is no established DS screening program in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Objective: The total number of DS pregnancies is increasing, probably due mainly to the increasing proportion of older mothers. Live birth with DS increased also so, there is an expected increase in long term survivors. There is a need for a well structured system for prenatal diagnosis and follow up program and an extra health care resource. Design: A systematic literature search for various prenatal screening tests for DS were explored regarding the time of screening during pregnancy, detection rate, false positive rate, advantages and disadvantages. Various search engines like Pub med, Medline, Index Medicus were used to review the published literature using the key words \"Down syndrome\", \"antenatal screening\", and “Chromosomal abnormalities\". Results: Different screening strategies for DS are applied worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the combined test, the integrated test or the serum integrated test is offered for women who present in the first trimester, and the quadruple test for those who present in the second trimester. In the United States, Canada, and Australia the combined test is recommended for the first trimester and the quadruple test for the second trimester. Conclusion: The Quadruple test should be offered to all pregnant women in the second trimester, in addition all women should be offered a second –trimester ultrasound scan to identify major and minor fetal abnormalities.

Place and Duration of Study: Research laboratories, Department of Medical Laboratories, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University from April 2010 to April 2011. Methodology: One-hundred diabetic patients with retinopathy recruited from King Fahad Specialist Hospital- Buraidah were included in the study. The control groups were: control group 1 consisted of sixty type 2 diabetic patients without retinopathy recruited from Diabetes and Endocrinology Center, KFSH, Buraidah, KSA; and control group 2 consisted of sixty healthy \"non diabetic subjects\" recruited from public places, i.e. Estarahes (party lounges). Plasma, serum, and erythrocyte lysate were prepared from blood of each subject. Human serum 8-OHdG, plasma MDA, and erythrocyte lysate Cu-Zn SOD were estimated by using commercial kits supplied by Northwest, U.S.A. Data was analyzed using SPSS software and Win Episcope software.

Methodology: We describe a cohort of patients diagnosed with NCPH in a HIV academic clinic with emphasis on their follow-up and outcomes after NCPH diagnosis. Results: During the study period, eight HIV-infected men were diagnosed with NCPH. All patients were exposed to Didanosine (ddI) for a median of 37 months. One patient died soon after NCPH diagnosis due to a condition unrelated to NCPH. The other seven patients have received B-blocker therapy and annual esophago-gastro-duodenectomy screenings with banding of esophageal varices when indicated and remain still alive. Three patients were on ddI at the time of NCPH diagnosis. In one patient ddI was discontinued shortly after NCPH diagnosis. The other two patients continued to use ddI after NCPH diagnosis and developed recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the subsequent 2 years, requiring revascularization interventions. The four patients that were already off ddI at the time of NCPH diagnosis have been followed for a median of 6 years. These four patients remained minimally symptomatic for up to 16 years of follow-up from NCPH diagnosis.

Methodology: A sample of 343 youths aged 9-18 years from schools in an area severely affected by the fire completed self-reported questionnaires. The Children’s Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder-Reaction Index-Revised (CPTSD-RI-R), the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) were used to assess relative symptoms, while fire-related stressors were also examined in respondents. Results: The estimated prevalence rates of high levels of PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms four months after the disaster were approximately 45%, 34% and 32%, respectively. Staying without both parents after the fire was strongly associated with more PTSD symptoms, while housing adversity and loss of property were most strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Life-threatening experience of a loved one and worry for a loved one predicted higher levels of PTSD symptomatology, whereas injury of a loved one was associated with high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: A significant proportion of children and adolescents exposed to 2007 Greek forest fires experienced mental health problems four months after the fire.

Study design: Prospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, August 2009 and ongoing. Methodology: We examined the reaction severity of twenty-four subjects to nine possible food allergens: milk, egg, almond, cashew, hazelnut, peanut, sesame, pecan and walnut. Specific IgE and SPT were performed before each DBPCFC. DBPCFC results were classified into mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) reactions using a modified Bock’s criteria. Results: Twenty four subjects underwent a total of 80 DBPCFC. Eighty percent of all DBPCFCs resulted in a positive reaction. A majority, 71%, were classified as mild. No reactions occurred with a SPT of zero mm while three reactions occurred with a negative specific IgE. All reactions were reversible with medication. Conclusion: These data suggest that SPT and specific IgE levels are not associated with reaction severity (p&lt;0.64 and 0.27, respectively). We also found that combining specific IgE and SPT improved specificity but did not help to achieve clinically useful sensitivity. For instance, an SPT &gt; 5mm had a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 50%. Combining SPT &gt; 5mm and IgE &gt; 7 resulted in a reduced sensitivity of 64%.

Two were able to cancel or postpone joint surgery(knee and ankle)and one cancelled an yttrium injection. Conclusions: There were no SAEs and prolonged benefit was found with ia anti-TNF and steroids and lidocaine compared to previous ia steroids with lidocaine in the majority (20/27). Although not approved for ia administration, ia anti-TNFs may be cost effective in persistent synovitis of one or two joints recalcitrant to ia steroids."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T07:32:55Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Inta-articular;"},{"subject":"injection;"},{"subject":"anti-tumour necrosis factor;"},{"subject":"inflammatory arthritis."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-12-06","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-12-06","titles":[{"title":"The Safety And Effectiveness Of Single And Repeat Dosing Of Intra-Articular Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Treatment After Failure Of Intra-Articular Steroids"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7787","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:13Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7787","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The objective of the study was to study whether stressful work involvement (i.e. worrying about work and job dissatisfaction) is related to arrhythmic risk in LQTS. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: The study took place in Finland in 2006 for the LQTS mutation carriers and 2007 for the general Finnish population. Methodology: The study subjects included 164 symptomatic and 229 asymptomatic LQTS mutation carriers from the Finnish LQTS registry and 1368 comparison subjects randomly derived from the population-based sample, Young Finns Study (YFS). Stressful work involvement was measured with questions derived from the Framingham type A scale. Results: Upon assessment of the stressful work involvement, symptomatic LQTS mutation carriers scored higher than asymptomatic LQTS mutation carriers (1.51 vs. 1.40, p=0.003, η²=0.022) and the general Finnish population (1.51 vs. 1.39, p&lt;0.001, η²=0.012), while asymptomatic LQTS mutation carriers did not differ from the general Finnish population in the corresponding scores (1.40 vs. 1.39, p=0.374, η²&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The results confirm the suggestion that perceived stress, in terms of stressful work involvement, may increase the likelihood of arrhythmic events in LQTS mutation carriers. Thus, individual stress proneness may be a risk factor for LQT symptoms, which should be taken into account in counseling LQTS patients. There is previous evidence that stress proneness can be modified by behavioral therapy."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T07:33:36Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Stress;"},{"subject":"stressful work involvement;"},{"subject":"arrhythmias;"},{"subject":"Long QT-Syndrome (LQTS)."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-12-06","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-12-06","titles":[{"title":"Stressful Work Involvement And Inherited Long Qt-Syndrome"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7788","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:13Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7788","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Further, high throughput genotyping of large population cohorts with help of high dense panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and application of advanced tools for analysis of extended blocks of linkage disequilibrium within a candidate gene (SNP tagging, etc.) revealed the presence of several susceptibility genes in the regions of linkage on chromosome 2q (CTLA-4), 8q (Tg), 14q (TSHR), 20q (CD40), 5q (SCGB3A2/UGRP1) and, probably, Xp (FOXP3).

We reviewed the literature to analyse the results of available noncell- based and cell-based strategies for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. Study design: Review Article Place and Duration of Study: University College London Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, Middlesex, HA7 4LP, United Kingdom Methodology: We reviewed the literature to identify studies on the use of non-cellbased and cell-based strategies for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. Results: Repair techniques that do not utilise cell therapy include bone marrow stimulating techniques such as microfracture that is effective in small well-contained lesions and has the advantages of being performed arthroscopically as a single stage and cheaper costs compared to cell-based therapies. It also associated with no donor site morbidity unlike mosaicplasty, and perichondrial or periosteal grafting. The evidence suggests that none of the techniques described above consistently produce durable results. There are encouraging mid-term results with Autologous Matrix Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC) procedures in small number of patients. Although microfracture is appropriate for smaller cartilage defects, Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) and Matrix-carried Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI), as well as other cell carrier systems, are currently used to treat larger full thickness chondral defects in the knee. Although the results are fairly similar, MACI and procedures using other cell carrier systems are amenable to be performed arthroscopically or through a more limited approach. There are a small number of studies using mesenchymal stem cells with promising early results bur further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed before this treatment becomes more routinely available.

Methods: A prospective case control study was done, which recruited female patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, follow up cases of treated breast cancers, and recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (Group A). Another group of control volunteers, presenting with benign breast diseases, in the surgical clinics was incorporated (Group B). Serum vitamin D levels of both groups were compared. Results: 50 patients were included in each group. Age ranged 21-76 years with a mean of 47.6 years. The levels of vitamin D in Group A were significantly lower than those in Group B (Odd ratio 55.5); two-tailed p value &lt;0.05.

Study design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Neurology, People’s Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Department of Rehabilitation, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, between March 2008 and March 2010. Methodology: We included 90 patients (58 men, 32 women; age range 21-45 years) with ischemic stroke. Psychological distress was evaluated with Symptom Distress Checklist (SCL-90, Chinese version). The 90 patients with ischemic stroke at the acute stage have completed the SCL-90 and the scores were analyzed statistically against the national Norm of China. Results: Compared with the national norm of China, there were great differences in almost all aspects such as depression, anxiety, somatization, phobia and psychoticism (P &lt;0.01, P&lt;0.001, respectively) except for obsessiveness-compulsiveness, hostility and paranoid ideation (P&gt;0.05 respectively). Among 90 stroke patients, the occurrence of Depression/Anxiety was 39 (43.33%). Female patients took up 75%, while male for 25% (P&lt;0.01). Education levels made no difference (P &gt; 0.05). Different payments brought out marked differences; the occurrence of Depression/Anxiety was 29.2% for the group where the medical expense paid by medical insurance, but 66.7% paid at one’s own expense (P&lt; 0.05). Different injured regions brought out marked difference in the psychological reaction (P&lt; 0.05), the occurrence of Depression/Anxiety was 75% with bilateral hemispheres injures. Conclusion: The psychological reactions of the young to the ischemic stroke are depression, anxiety, somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism except for obsessive-compulsiveness, hostility and paranoid ideation.

Conclusion: Several characteristics of BM-MSCs make them ideal candidates in managing musculoskeletal injuries. Bone marrow is easy to obtain requiring minimal donor site morbidity, invasiveness and anaesthetic. Their autologous nature eliminates the issue of immunoreactions and ethical problems.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying this is critical to developing early diagnostic or treatment strategies. We devised a pilot study to examine the role of g-SYNUCLEIN (g-SYN), oestrogen receptor (ER)a, and the splice variant ERaΔ3. Methodology: With ethical approval, ovarian tissue was collected from patients (n=24) undergoing oopherectomy for non-ovarian pathology or primary surgery for suspected ovarian cancer. Quantitative gene expression analysis was employed for g-SYN, ERa, and ERaΔ3. To identify the in situ localization, immunofluorescence for g-syn was carried out. Results: Ovarian tumour tissue exhibited an elevated expression of g-SYN and high-grade tumours had an elevated ERaΔ3:ERa ratio compared with benign tissue. The majority of previous studies point to the g-syn protein being present in epithelial cells of high-grade disease. Our study supports this, but additionally we conclusively identify its presence in the endothelial cells of vasculature surrounding low-grade disease; immunofluorescence was strongest in the apical cells surrounding the lumen. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate for the first time that there are readily-expressed levels of g-SYN and ERaΔ3 in normal ovarian tissue and ovarian tumours. In high-grade disease, g-syn and an elevated ERaΔ3:ERa ratio might confer metastatic potential to the tumourigenic cells and promote neoangiogenesis. Future in vitro studies might be necessary to delineate such a mechanism, which could potentially be the basis of early intervention."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T09:42:01Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Endothelial cells;"},{"subject":"ovarian cancer;"},{"subject":"ERa;"},{"subject":"ERaΔ3;"},{"subject":"g-SYNUCLEIN;"},{"subject":"neoangiogenesis."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-09-14","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-09-14","titles":[{"title":"Expression Of Eralfa, Its Eralfatrangle3 Splice Variant And Gama-Synuclein In Ovarian Cancer: A Pilot Study"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7802","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:15Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7802","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: We examined the reaction severity of twenty-four subjects to nine possible food allergens: milk, egg, almond, cashew, hazelnut, peanut, sesame, pecan and walnut. Specific IgE and SPT were performed before each DBPCFC. DBPCFC results were classified into mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) reactions using a modified Bock’s criteria. Results: Twenty four subjects underwent a total of 80 DBPCFC. Eighty percent of all DBPCFCs resulted in a positive reaction. A majority, 71%, were classified as mild. No reactions occurred with a SPT of zero mm while three reactions occurred with a negative specific IgE. All reactions were reversible with medication. Conclusion: These data suggest that SPT and specific IgE levels are not associated with reaction severity (p&lt;0.64 and 0.27, respectively). We also found that combining specific IgE and SPT improved specificity but did not help to achieve clinically useful sensitivity. For instance, an SPT &gt; 5mm had a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 50%. Combining SPT &gt; 5mm and IgE &gt; 7 resulted in a reduced sensitivity of 64%.

Age-induced oxidative stress has been proposed to correlate with this age-related microvascular dysfunction including angiogenesis impairment. It has been demonstrated that exercise training could ameliorate oxidative damage, as well as, enhance angiogenesis in various organs. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate whether exercise training can prevent alterations of capillary vascularity in brain and bone during aging. Design and method: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sedentary-young (aged 4-6 months), sedentary-aged (aged 20-22 months) and train-aged (aged 20-22 months). The exercise program included swimming training 5 days/week for 8 weeks. We directly observed microvasculature of brain and bone by using a laser scanning confocal microscopic system. The microvascular networks were visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled dextran and were analyzed for capillary vascularity by image analysis software. Blood was collected to determine the level of malondialdehyde, an indicator of oxidative stress. Results: In sedentary-aged group, the malondialdehyde level was significantly increased, whereas capillary vascularities in brain and bone were significantly decreased when compared to the sedentary-young group (P&lt;0.05). In train-aged group, capillary vascularities in brain and bone were significantly higher, whereas the malondialdehyde level was significantly lower when compared to the sedentary-aged group (P&lt;0.05). Besides, the result also showed a linear correlation between capillary vascularity and malondialdehyde level. Conclusion: The exercise training could attenuate age-induced suppression of capillary vascularity in brain and bone, closely related to exercise-ameliorated oxidative stress during aging."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T09:44:01Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Exercise training;"},{"subject":"aging;"},{"subject":"capillary vascularity;"},{"subject":"antioxidant;"},{"subject":"oxidative stress;"},{"subject":"laser scanning confocal microscopy;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-08-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-08-28","titles":[{"title":"Exercise Training Could Reduce Age-Induced Microvascular Impairment Related To Its Anti-Oxidant Potential"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7805","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:16Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7805","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: College of Medical Sciences, University of Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria between February – September 2010. Methodology: Self descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 169 Medical students (MBBS II-V) between the ages 19-46 years. Respondents were selected from each class using stratified random sampling method. Stratification was done according to their class. Questionnaires were designed and administered to the respondents to complete. Three researchers and two research assistances were on site to assist. Students were briefed on the objective of the study and duly completed questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Subjects who had primary amenorrhea and/or history of abdominal or pelvic surgery were not eligible for the study. The questionnaire included data such as; age of menarche, menstrual pattern, severity of pain (dysmenorrheal), marital status, effects of exercise, socioeconomic status, Body mass Index (BMI) and Diet. The method of observation involved personal interaction and questioning of respondent to find out if they had anything peculiar about their cycle. The number of days of menstrual flow on menarche and number of pads use per day were in the questionnaire. Results: It was observed that 148(87.6%) respondents had regular length of menstrual cycle, particularly in the age groups 20-22 and 23-26 years which recorded 39 and 43 respondents respectively. Irregular menstrual cycle was found in 21(12.4%) respondents, which showed its peak at the age group of 17-19(33.3%) years, between age groups. It was also observed that 118(69.8%) respondents had painful menstrual flow, out of which 71(60.2%) had mild pain, 30(29.7%) had moderate pain while 17(14.4%) had severe pain. Result of length of menstrual cycle between single and married respondents showed that, 20(71.4%) of single respondents had short menstrual length compared to 8(28.6%) married respondents of corresponding short menstrual length. It was revealed that in 148(87.6) respondents that had regular menstrual cycle type, 106(71.6%) menstrual flow was average, while in 31(21.0%), it was scanty and heavy in 11(7.4%) respondents. 10(47.6%) respondent had average irregular menstrual cycle, while 9(42.9%) and 2(9.5%) respondents had scanty and heavy irregular menstrual cycles The result showed no significant variation in frequency of menstrual cycle (p=0.5). 99(58.6%) of respondents did no physical exercise; while 70(41.4%) did at least 30 minutes exercise (p=0.38). 101(59.8%) respondents belong to high upper, 51(30.2%) in upper-middle and 17(10.0%) belonged to lower socioeconomic status (p=0.14). 135(80.0%) respondents had daily fast food habits, out of which 95(80.5%) had positive history of pain and 34(20.0%) had no daily fast food (P=0.80). 30(17.8) respondents were underweight, 120(71.0%) had average weight and 19(11.2%) respondents were overweight (p=0.20). Conclusion: Study has established mean age at menarche, menstrual pattern and menstrual disorder (pain) in relation to BMI, exercise and socioeconomic factor among female Medical Students of University of Maiduguri, Nigeria.

In Bcells, BCR-mediated signalling is regulated in part by the amount of membrane cholesterol. It was observed that Statins, pharmacological inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, induce apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro and in vivo. Having previously reported that ectopic expression of CD5 in a B-cell line stimulated the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol, we investigated the expression and synthesis of cholesterol in CLL B-cells. Study Design &amp; Methodology: Plasma membrane cholesterol in CLL cells was evaluated by staining with Filipin and Flow cytometry in 26 patients. CLL cells were cultured with Lovastatin and subG1 cells and Gumprecht’s shadows counted thereafter; surface expression of IgM, CD19 and CD5 was analysed. The expression of cholesterol synthesis genes was investigated in transcriptomic data from the MILE project (150 CLL and 110 controls). Results: We confirmed that leukemic B-cells contained more cholesterol in their plasma membranes than their normal counterparts. An enhanced expression of genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in CLL as compared to healthy controls was observed. Interestingly, among the 150 CLL patients analyzed, four cholesterol synthesis genes were activated in 65 “Ig-mutated” (M) in comparison to 69 “Ig-unmutated” (UM) CLLs. Leukemic cells cultured with Lovastatin exhibited a dose-response apoptosis, however surface IgM expression was unaffected and CD19 and CD5 were downregulated at highest concentrations only.

Astrocytes expressing different serotonin receptors (5-HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) are affected by fluoxetine administration. The study was conducted to revise whether fluoxetine treatment during postnatal brain development results in long-term changes of astroglia. Methodology: Thus, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR analyses were performed at different postnatal periods in rats to investigate short- and long-term changes following by a 14-day administration with fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/BW s.c. once daily). Results: Fluoxetine-treatments from postnatal day (pd) 1-15, measured at pd 16, led to a significant reduction of GFAP gene (Gfap) in hippocampus and GFAP protein expression in the dentate gyrus and CA1 without changes at pd 90 compared to controls. Treatments from pd 21-35 resulted in a significant decrease of Gfap and protein (measured 24 hours after last injection) in striatum (putamen), frontal cortex and hippocampus. Contrary, if measured at day 90, the same treatment led to a significant increase in those regions.

Thus, enteric pathogens remain a major factor contributing to persistent poverty and poor health in developing nations. Novel mucosal vaccination strategies are emerging that can protect epithelial surfaces and therefore promise a simple, effective and safe interventional therapy to overcome the mortality generated by these debilitating infectious diseases. Before the full potential for mucosal vaccination against enteric diseases can be realized, the innate immune system must be strengthen by addressing secondary problems such as malnutrition, malabsorption and gastrointestinal tract impairment. Here we describe the major enteric pathogens responsible for childhood morbidity and mortality in developing and resource-limited countries.

Ischemic optic neuropathy is a rare cause of blindness reported most commonly in association with collagen-vascular diseases, infectious processes, and systemic hypotension related to massive exsanguinating hemorrhage. Aim: To report 2 cases of bilateral complete visual loss following massive uterine hemorrhage. Case reports: Case 1 is a 23 year-old unmarried female student who first presented at our Eye Clinic on account of bilateral visual loss of 5 months duration. She had, had a septic abortion and profuse bleeding per vaginum for over a week before visual loss. Case 2 is a 39 year-old unmarried school teacher who presented on account of sudden bilateral visual loss of two months duration following myomectomy. Postoperatively, patient was transfused 4 pints of blood. Conclusion: Since sudden visual loss could follow non-ocular surgical procedures, surgeons must always be on the alert and ensure they avoid conditions that could predispose a patient to optic nerve ischemia; conditions such as perioperative drops in systemic blood pressure and hematocrit values. Normotension during and after surgery, is therefore vital in preventing optic nerve ischemia."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T09:47:01Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Sudden bilateral blindness;"},{"subject":"massive uterine bleeding."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-03-29","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-03-29","titles":[{"title":"Sudden Bilateral Blindness Following Massive Uterine Bleeding: Reports Of 2 Cases"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7810","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:17Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7810","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: Biochemistry Research Laboratory, Central India Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur between June 2009 and July 2010. Methodology: 29 TBM and 22 non TBM CSF samples were collected. Indirect ELISA was performed for evaluating the, M. tb Hsp16 and Hsp71 in the collected samples, individually as well as in combination. The ELISA method for detection of M. tb Hsp 71 was also compared with in house PCR technique for TBM diagnosis. Results: The data analysis was done with MedCalc® Software. M. tb Hsp16 showed positivity of 58.62% and negativity of 68.18%. Similarly for M. tb Hsp71, positivity is 89.65% and negativity is 68.18%.The results of ELISA for M. tb Hsp71 was compared with PCR technique and concordance was also calculated. Of the Hsp ELISA positive group for M. tb Hsp71, 24 were PCR positive and 2 were PCR negative with the 92.30 % concordance in TBM patients and in non TBM patients the concordance was observed to be 93.30%. Use of the monoclonal antibody Hsp 71 appear preferable over individual use of M. tb Hsp 16 and combined use of both Hsp and yield optimum results. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the detection of M. tb Hsp 71 in the CSF sample of TBM patients can be useful for the diagnosis of TBM patients.

Methodology: The animals were randomly divided into five groups of 5 rats each. Group1 served as the normal control (NC) and received distilled water. Group 2, the cholesterol-induced hyperlipidemic control (CHOL) was given cholesterol diet (20% groundnut oil, 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid mixed with rat pellet) orally. Groups 3 and 4 received oral administration of cholesterol diet and MEPA at a dose of 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight respectively, while group 5 was treated orally with cholesterol diet and cholestyramine (0.26g/kg body weight). Cholesterol diet, MEPA and cholestyramine were administered daily for a period of eight weeks. Results: The changes observed in the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) of hyperlipidemic control rats were reversed by MEPA in a dose-dependent manner. At 20 mg/kg body weight, MEPA significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced TC, TG and LDL plasma levels by 54.2%, 46.2% and 65.6% respectively, and increased HDL plasma level by 60.0%. At a higher dose of 40 mg/kg, MEPA reduced TC, TG and LDL levels by 60.4%, 69.2% and 87.5% respectively while HDL was increased by 80.0%. There was a significant increase of change in body weight of hyperlipidemic rats compared to the change in normal control. MEPA caused a reduction of change in body weight to nearly that of the normal control. MEPA also dose-dependently caused significant reduction (p&lt;0.05) of plasma lipid peroxidation in the rats. The anti-hyperlipidemic effect of MEPA was comparable to that of the standard drug, cholestyramine.

However, in these models the animals must be used only after the severe systemic immune suppression in order to ensure graft survival. Thus, additional new human brain tumor models without immune suppression of the recipient rodent may be required. Place and Duration of Study: Laboratory of Immunochemistry, V.P. Serbsky National Research Centre for Social and Forensic Psychiatry and Department of Nanobiotechnology, N.I. Pirogov Russian State Medical University and Department of Biosynthesis of Nucleic Acids, Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics between June 2009 and July 2010. Methodology: Brain tumor modeling was performed by intracerebral stereotactic implantation of cells to the healthy adult rats without any artificial immunodepression. Cells were implanted to the striatum region of ketamine-anesthetized rats at specific coordinates according to Swanson's rat brain atlas. Tumor growth was monitored weekly via registration of neurological signs and in vivo Bruker MRI system. Results: On the 21st day after implantation of C6 glioma, U251 or 293_CHI3L1 cells severe neurological deficit appeared in rats. Huge intracerebral tumors were found in each animal under investigation while no tumor growth was observed for at least 8 weeks in rats injected with empty vector-transfected 293 cells. Tumors contained the dense superficial cell layer and prominent lobules with central newly ingrowing blood vessels. Histological assay revealed displacement of median cerebral structures and hydrocephalus in contralateral hemisphere. All tumors were surrounded by numerous GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes. Conclusion: Positive results with transplantation of 293_CHI3L1 cells into adult rat brains without any immunosupression show the validity of this animal model.

In this study, we demonstrate the potential of miRNAs to regulate other miRNAs. Using miRNA microarray analysis, we show that over 70 different miRNAs are differentially expressed (≥1.4 fold, FDR≤5%) in human ovarian cancer cells after transfection with a single miRNA (miR-7). We present evidence that a major component of miR-7 induced changes in levels of miRNAs is the indirect consequence of miR-7 mediated alterations in levels of protein coding genes (e.g., transcription and splicing factors) that exert trans-regulatory control on miRNAs."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T09:51:33Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"miRNA;"},{"subject":"ovarian cancer;"},{"subject":"systems biology;"},{"subject":"miR-7;"},{"subject":"NF-κB."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-02-21","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-02-21","titles":[{"title":"Micrornas Indirectly Regulate Other Micrornas In Ovarian Cancer Cells"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7817","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:18Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7817","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: We have conducted a study using Web search in accordance with the perspective of physicians or patients for the relevant prevention and pharmacotherapy guidelines in the management of AR as developed by professional and health care organizations in Asia-Pacific countries/regions. Results: National allergy (AR and/or asthma) preventive programs are found in only 6 out of 17 (22.2%) countries (excluding Japan and South Korea). There exist several aspects of discrepancies in existing educational programs such as in (1) allergic disease (asthma or AR) that the guidelines focus on; (2) targeted age groups (children or adults); and (3) breadth and depth of coverage, such as for particular inhalant allergens or food allergies only. Based on the information provided by MIMS website (updated in 2011 by UBM Medica, London, United Kingdom) and the MIMS proven by the country’s local health authority, controversies exist in recommended minimum age, doses and potential side-effects of many commonly used 2nd-generation antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids.

To the best of our knowledge, only one retroperitoneal EGIST case has been reported in Oncolgy, in 2005（PubMed search result). Case Report: A 67-year old female patient presented with epigastric discomfort, dyspepsia, and anemia. Ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen showed the location of the tumor was between the tail of the pancreas and the spleen (retroperitoneal), it was variable in size of 12.3cm×7.2cm×14cm. Color Doppler Flow Imaging (CDFI) showed no flow signals with arterial-venous doppler spectrum in the masses．Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass (8.23cm×14.2cm) and abundant blood supply of the tumor. The patient underwent gastroscopes-guided biopsy from the fundus of stomach for pathologic diagnosis and the result indicated chronic superficial gastritis. A complete gross excision was performed. Retroperitoneal tylectomy, left hepatic lobectomy, enterolysis, and liver biopsy were performed. Two weeks post operation, the patient was discharged without any postoperative problems. The final diagnosis of retroperitoneal EGIST was confirmed by histopathological examination and immunohistochemical findings (CD117 positivity). Conclusion: We report a very rare case of retroperitoneal EGIST. Although the Ultrasonographic examination, computer tomography and endoscopy examination did not confirm the final diagnosis, they are complemented to each other in order to identify the exact location of the tumor.

However, vascular pain occasionally requires switching of the drip infusion route. Some investigators reported that addition of steroids to oxaliplatin drip infusion is useful in controlling vascular pain. However, the pharmacological use of steroids can make oxaliplatin unstable due to the elevation of pH; further, the effectiveness of steroid in this therapy is unknown. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of dexamethasone (DEX) for controlling vascular pain caused by the administration of oxaliplatin via the peripheral vein. Study design: Retrospective study. Place and duration of the Study: Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine, between April 2010 and November 2011. Methodology: The study included 69 patients who received XELOX + bevacizumab therapy for advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. In all the patients, oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) was administered in combination with DEX (6.6 mg) via the peripheral vein. Results: Vascular pain developed in 47 patients (68.1%), but it was transient. No patients required CV port implantation. Grade 3 or higher hemotoxicity was noted in 14.5% of the patients, and grade 3 or higher nonhematological toxicity was noted in 20.3% of the patients. The response rate was 59.4%. One patient experienced hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin. Conclusions: The recorded response rate combined with the use of DEX suggests that DEX probably does not exert adverse effects on the therapy, ie, it does not affect the stability of oxaliplatin by elevating the pH. DEX may be useful not only for controlling vascular pain caused by the administration of oxaliplatin via the peripheral vein but also for controlling oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity reactions."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T09:54:15Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Oxaliplatin;"},{"subject":"dexamethasone;"},{"subject":"vascular pain;"},{"subject":"hypersensitivity;"},{"subject":"colorectal cancer."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-01-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-01-31","titles":[{"title":"Dexamethasone As A Means Not Only For Controlling Vascular Pain Caused By The Administration Of Oxaliplatin Via The Peripheral Vein But Also For Controlling Oxaliplatin- Induced Hypersensitivity Reactions"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7821","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:18Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7821","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Experimental study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Egypt, between June 2009 and July 2011. Methodology: One hundred male and female albino rats of the Wistar strain (Rattus norvegicus) aging 1, 6, 18, 30 &amp; 42 months were used during experimentation. At the mentioned ages, the animals were sacrificed by diethyl ether and ocular regions were dissected and lens separated. Amino acids content were determined in both lenses of five individuals. In the other five individuals, unilateral ectomized lenses were subjected for chemical determination of calcium, sodium, cupper and magnesium. The rest lenses on the other side were fixed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin followed by 2.5% glutaraldhyde for scanning electron microscopic investigation. Statistically analysis was carried out by the help of SPSS software. Results: The estimated amino acids were altered in both sexes with advancement of aging. The lens amino acids; taurine, prolline, serine, threonine, methionine, lysine and arginine were markedly increased during aging comparing with apparent depletion of asparate, valine and methionine. The alterations in amino acid contents were parallel with increased accumulation of calcium, sodium and cupper and a depletion of magnesium content. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) observations exhibited sequences of changes of the structures of lens fibers and their pattern of attachments during the advancement of aging. In the advanced aged group, the lens fibers become fragile and widely separated as a result of loosely attached of the interfibrillar junctions of the ball and socket especially at 30 &amp; 42 month old rats. Conclusion: Aging led to alterations of lens fibers at ultrastructural levels associated with diversity of changes in their amino acids contents parallel with increase accumulation of sodium, calcium and cupper and a decrease of magnesium content. The observed findings may be attributed to the increase of advanced glycation end products initiated oxidative stress, impairing lens structure and function."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T09:55:31Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Aging;"},{"subject":"lens;"},{"subject":"amino acids;"},{"subject":"minerals;"},{"subject":"sodium;"},{"subject":"calcium;"},{"subject":"cupper;"},{"subject":"magnesium;"},{"subject":"SEM."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-02-14","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-02-14","titles":[{"title":"Biochemical And Ultrastructural Changes In Lens During Aging Of Wistar Albino Rats"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7823","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:19Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7823","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: The study was carried out with the sample size of 30 histopathologically diagnosed cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma and comparison of infiltration of these (tissue eosinophil and mast cells) inflammatory cells with control (normal) group of patients, was done by using special stains. Special stains are wonderful because they allow us to see which we cannot see with routine Haematoxylin and eosin stain. Special stains were used to demonstrate tissue eosinophils and mast cells. Carbol Chromotrope and congo red were used for tissue eosinophil and for mast cells staining toluidine blue and thionin were used. Results: The comparison of infiltration of tissue eosinophil and mast cell in OSCC with control group (normal) of patients shows significantly increased infiltration of these immunological cells in OSCC group of patients (P&lt;0.05). We also found that among special stains carbol chromotrope is better than congo red for demonstration of tissue eosinophils and toluidine blue shows better staining intensity for mast cells than thionin. Conclusion: We conclude that both inflammatory cells i.e. number of tissue eosinophils and mast cell infiltration is increased in OSCC.

Study Design: Retrospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Human Anatomy and Department of Radiology (University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital), University of Maiduguri, Borno State Nigeria between February 2007 and June 2008. Methodology: Four hundred (400) radiographs of adult Nigerians (200 males and 200 females) were measured. Age range for the individuals was 18-76 years. Radiographs used for this study were obtained from the collection of record unit of the Radiology Department, University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) in Borno state, Nigeria.Radiographic viewing box, temporary maker, pencil and a meter rule were used for the measurements.The radiographs for males and females were classified separately into six (6) age groups with ten (10) years interval. Vertical and Horizontal diameters of lumbar pedicle were represented on the radiographs by “h” (taken as the maximum dimension of the pedicle between the upper and lower margins of the pedicles) and by “t” (maximum diameter between the medial and lateral aspect of each pedicle). Distance between upper and lower extremities, as well as that between medial and lateral extremities of each pedicle were marked and measured as vertical and horizontal diameters respectively. Results: The result of the present study showed that, the vertical and horizontal diameters of the lumbar pedicles in adult Nigerians were all greater in male than in female counterpart. It was also observed that sexual differences in the two parameters were found to be statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) in both sexes. Index of sexual dimorphism (ISD) was also calculated and it was observed that all parameters were found to be greater than 100; this showed that male had higher values over female counterpart. Demarking points were also calculated for each parameter, the result also showed similar pattern of increase in male parameters over female counterpart. The result also showed age-related significant (P&lt;0.001) variations for the lumbar pedicle diameters, from 18-27 through 38-47 years age groups with a decrease in diameters at the 48-57 through 68-77 years age groups in both sexes. Conclusion: It was observed that the vertical and horizontal diameters were sexually dimorphic; the demarking points of male diameter were all higher than those of the female counterpart. Index of sexual dimorphism also showed that male vertical and horizontal diameters were all greater than female vertical diameter as the index of sexual dimorphism were all greater than 100 from L1 through L5. This study reconfirms the fact that osteometric assessment is highly population- specific.

A question about lifetime exposure to occupational physical activity (OPA) was used in a population-based survey (part of the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank, CAMB). The aim of the study was to validate this question through a three-step process. Methodology: Firstly, the response process was studied by cognitive interviewing of 7 persons. Secondly, 64 persons participated in semi-structured interviews about their worklife, and expert judgments of exposure to OPA were compared with questionnaire-data. Exposure was 20 years of work in one of four categories of OPA: sedentary, standing and walking, moderate or high OPA. Kappa values were calculated for agreement and interpreted according to Landis and Koch’s criteria. Agreement was visualized in Bland- Altman plots. Thirdly, intra- and inter-rater reliability of expert judgments was tested. Results: Response process: The question had a complicated instruction, and the respondents found it hard to remember, categorize, and summate exposures. Semistructured interviews: Kappa value for exposure to sedentary work was ‘substantial’ (0.71) but ‘fair’ for the other categories of OPA (0.27-0.29). Agreement between questionnaire and interview was higher in sedentary jobs and jobs with high OPA. Intra-rater reliability of expert judgments was ‘substantial’ or ‘moderate’ (0.60-0.71). Inter-rater reliability was high in sedentary jobs but lower in the more active jobs. Conclusion: Self-reports of lifetime exposure to sedentary work are valid in the CAMB cohort, whereas the validity of self-reports of exposure to high levels of occupational physical activity (OPA) are questionable.

Study Design: Retrospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Comparative Molecular Medicine and department of Animal and Population Health, School of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool. Methodology: Twenty four achieved Salmonella isolates of equine faecal origin, previously collected from a UK equine hospital, were serotyped, phagetyped and tested both for antimicrobial susceptibility, by disc diffusion (BSAC) and for genetic relatedness by XbaI I-PFGE. Results: Most isolates were Salmonella typhimurium (n=21), including five DT104; two were Salmonella enteritidis, and one was untypeable. Sixteen isolates, including five Salmonella typhimurium DT104 isolates exhibiting the classic penta-resistance phenotype (ACSSuT), were characterized as multidrug resistant (MDR). Fourteen MDR isolates showed additional resistance to florfenicol, although no resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected. MDR isolates showed two dominant resistance phenotypes: ACTSSuFlo (N=8) resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole and florfenicol and ACTTrSSuFlo (N=6) which is also resistant to trimethoprim. Dendrogram analysis identified eleven distinct genetic groups showing an overall similarity of 84%. The dominant resistance phenotypes were located mainly in two genetic groups: ACTSSuFlo isolates were all collected in the same year and were restricted to one clonal PFGE group showing &gt;99.5% genetic similarity; ACTTrSSuFlo isolates were genetically more diverse with 4/6 clustering in a closelyrelated group showing 94% similarity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that although some Salmonella infections were introduced to the hospital from outside, infections spreading within the equine hospital could also be a reservoir of MDR Salmonella zoonotic infections and play a role in the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:00:36Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Zoonotic enteric bacteria;"},{"subject":"antimicrobial resistance;"},{"subject":"DT104;"},{"subject":"multidrug resistant Salmonella;"},{"subject":"PFGE."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-08-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-08-23","titles":[{"title":"Antibiotic Resistance And Chromosomal Variation In Equine Faecal Salmonella Spp."}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7831","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:19Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7831","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

We note that these and other pathologies are characterized by chronic inflammation (CI) as a risk factor. How these CI pathologies inhibit bone repair is unclear, but one candidate mediator is endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide/LPS). LPS promotes inflammation and is present in increased serum concentrations in some inflammatory conditions. The distraction osteogenesis (DO) model developed in this laboratory provides the opportunity to isolate and study the effects of CI on direct bone formation during bone regeneration. The aim of this study was to determine whether endotoxin at concentrations that mimic levels reported in chronic inflammatory conditions would impair bone formation in a mouse model of DO. Study Design: Mouse bone repair study. Place and Duration of Study: Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute, Little Rock, Arkansas, April to June 2009. Methodology: LPS or vehicle (PBS) was chronically administered to 11-week old mice via alzet pump. Mice underwent the DO protocol concurrently with LPS administration. Radiographic and histologic quantitation was performed on the DO gap to determine the amount of new bone formed. Results: Radiographic (51.9 ± 7% vehicle vs 21.0 ± 7.3% LPS: P &lt; .01) and histologic (68.1 ± 8.5% vehicle vs 33.6 ±10.3% LPS; P &lt; .02) results indicate that bone formation during DO was significantly decreased in LPS treated versus vehicle treated mice. Conclusion: The magnitude of the osteoinhibitory effects of systemic LPS in this mouse model of CI was equivalent to two months of ethanol treatment, 24 months of aging, or two months of Type 1 diabetes. These results support the hypothesis that LPS exposure could be responsible for the decreased bone formation observed in chronic inflammatory conditions."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:01:14Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Endotoxemia;"},{"subject":"LPS;"},{"subject":"mouse;"},{"subject":"distraction osteogenesis."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-08-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-08-23","titles":[{"title":"Metabolic Endotoxemia And Inhibition Of Direct Bone Regeneration: A Pilot Study"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7832","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:20Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7832","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the level of basic neurosurgical knowledge with regard to image interpretation in interns who were in their first postgraduate year in New Zealand. Study Design: Clinical and educational research paper. Place and Duration of Study: Wellington, New Zealand from January 2011 to January 2012. Methodology: Fifty interns in their first postgraduate year were invited to complete a neurosurgical imaging questionnaire with images of common neurosurgical findings (obvious subarachnoid and intracranial haemorrhages) randomly mixed with normal studies. Five computerized tomography (CT) scan images were required to be matched to five diagnoses. Results: All respondents agreed to participate. The mean score for the all 50 interns was 40% (95% CI 37.3 - 42.4), with a range of 0 to 80%. Thirty-six interns (72%) had a score of less than 60% and thus failed to demonstrate basic competency on the examination. None of the interns scored a full 100%.

Therefore, understanding the role of metabolites is important in elucidating the etiology and pathology of diseases and finding targets for new treatment options. Rheumatoid arthritis is a complex chronic disease for which new disease management strategies are needed. The aim of this review is to bring together and integrate information about the various roles that metabolites have in rheumatoid arthritis. An extensive PubMed search is conducted to collect the relevant manuscripts. The metabolites are discussed in relation to rheumatoid arthritis. Subsequently, the metabolites are organized according to levels of system organization. In the last section an integrated pathway analysis of the metabolites conducted with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software is presented. Literature search resulted in information about vitamins, eicosanoids, fatty acids, lipids, hormones and peptides. The metabolites could be related to metabolic processes, oxidative stress processes and inflammatory processes. Cell death, lipid metabolism and small molecule biochemistry were found by the pathway analysis to be the top functions, characterized by the metabolites arachidonic acid, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, cholecalciferol, hydrocortisone, keratan sulfate, melatonin, palmitic acid and stearic acid. These nine metabolites are highly connected to a number of canonical pathways related to immune functions, the production of nitric oxygen and reactive oxygen species in macrophages and pathways involved in arthritis. This review indicates groups of metabolites that could be interesting for metabolomics studies related to rheumatoid arthritis. Circadian rhythms of metabolite levels are found to be important for understanding and treating rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, some key processes and pathways are found by integrating the metabolite data.

Study Design: Non randomized control study. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted at the Department of Medical Elementology and Toxicology, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi during 2008-10. Methodology: Study was conducted in Swiss albino mice divided in five groups (n=6). Animals were challenged with Ehrlich’s ascites tumour cells (1x106 cells). Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg body weight), an alkylating anticancer drug that especially affects humoral immune functions, was injected intraperitoneally in a single dose. The protective effect of Unani drug Jawarish amla sada (250 mg/kg body weight) was studied in tumour bearing animals treated with cyclophosphamide. Immune function assessment test such as plaque forming cell assay (PFC) and biochemical parameters such as activities of antioxidant enzymes and reduced glutathione were measured in mice. Results: Jawarish amla sada significantly modulated the immunosuppressive effect of cyclophosphamide as compared to the group treated with cyclophosphamide. Jawarish amla sada also protected activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase and significantly restored level of reduced glutathione in liver and kidney of tumour bearing mice exposed to cyclophosphamide. Similar protective effect of Jawarish amla sada was observed against elevated lipid peroxidation in these tissues. Conclusion: Jawarish amla sada showed potential to provide protection against toxic effects of cyclophosphamide in tumour bearing mice.

Design: Retrospective case series. Patients: 54 cases were studied involving 46 unique patients (20 male, 26 female) seen between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008. All patients were ASA class II-III and were undergoing neuroangiographically-assisted embolization for intracranial AVMs. Intervention: Immediately prior to the injection of the embolic substance, each patient received a dose of nitroglycerin to lower their systolic blood pressure from baseline (112- 146 mm Hg) to a target of 55 mm Hg. Next, mechanical ventilation was suspended and manual pressure was applied to the ventilation bag of the anesthesia circuit to maintain a constant airway pressure of 20 cm H2O. This simulated Valsalva maneuver was maintained for 15 seconds after the injection of the embolic material, at which point mechanical ventilation was resumed. Main Results: All patients tolerated the deliberate hypotension/Valsalva protocol well. 2 patients experienced a rupture of the AVM during the procedure. Conclusions: The distal embolization of the embolic material during intracranial AVM embolization is a potentially fatal complication of this procedure. Although our results represent a small case series, they suggest that the use of deliberate arterial hypotension in addition to a simulated Valsalva maneuver may enhance the safety and efficacy of intracranial AVM embolization. Further study, with rigorous control standards and monitoring, is warranted."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:04:27Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Arteriovenous malformation;"},{"subject":"intraoperative hypotension;"},{"subject":"Valsalva maneuver;"},{"subject":"particle embolization."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-06-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-06-28","titles":[{"title":"Use Of The Valsalva Maneuver In Addition To Controlled Hypotension During Endovascular Avm Embolization: A Novel Approach To Reducing Distal Particle Embolization?"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7837","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:21Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7837","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Medicine and Department of Behavioral Sciences, University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria Between Januaryand June 2010. Methodology: One hundred and ninety-one consecutive patients on psychotropic medications with 121 controls were studied. All the subjects had detailed clinical examination and resting electrocardiogram (ECG) at 25mm/sec. QTc was determined using Bazett formula and QTd by subtracting shortest from longest QTc in 12-lead ECG. Results: Mean QTc of the patients (450±46msc) was longer (p=0.0001) than that of the controls (390±27msc) but mean QTd was similar (p=0.13) in both groups. QTc was prolonged in 68(35.6%) patients compared to 11(9.1%) controls, p=0.0001. LVH, arrhythmias and abnormal T-wave morphology occurred more (p=0.01, 0.01 and 0.001 respectively) in the patients than controls. Age, duration of treatment and total daily doses of antipsychotics were independent predictors of QTc. Cardiac arrhythmias were seen in 24.1% of the patients but none had ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusion: Psychotropic drug use is a risk factor for QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Clinical Research Unit, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA. United States. Methodology: Overweight and obese status denotes an increasing adipose tissue burden which spills over into ectopic locations, including the visceral compartment, muscle and liver. Associated co-morbidities enhance cardiovascular (CV) risk. Endothelium which is the largest receptor-effector end-organ in our bodies, while responding to numerous physical and chemical stimuli maintains vascular homeostasis. Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is the initial perturbation, which precedes fatty streak known to initiate atherosclerosis: insidious process which often culminates as sudden catastrophic CV adverse event.

Method: Records of forty seven (47) cases of inter family abduction that took place in 2007 in Greece were obtained. The majority of cases concerned relocation of children in a foreign country. A special inventory was developed for data collection. This consisted of three distinctive parts, for the father, the mother, or the abducted child. Results: Results showed that a typical abductive mother is of non Greek nationality, more likely of having psychiatric symptoms, without indication of substance abuse and no signs of violent behavior. Abductive fathers are of Greek nationality, less likely of having psychiatric symptoms, no substance abuse, and tend to exhibit violent behavior. Legal resolution of these cases and repatriation takes very long adding to the child and family’s distress. Conclusions: Child abduction is associated with cases of dissolved marriages.

To employ this technique pre-clinically, head movements and the stress of restraint are usually reduced by maintaining animals under general anaesthesia. However, interactions between the drug of interest and the anaesthetic employed may potentially confound data interpretation. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists used widely to mimic schizophrenia have recently been shown to interact with the anaesthetic halothane. It may be the case that neural and cerebrovascular responses to NMDAR antagonists are dependent on the types of anaesthetic used. Methodology: We compared the phMRI response to NMDAR antagonist ketamine in rats maintained under -chloralose to those under isoflurane anaesthesia. A randomized placebo/vehicle controlled design was used in each of the anaesthetic groups. Results: Changes in the anaesthetic agent resulted in two very different profiles of activity. In the case of -chloralose, positive activations in cortical and sub-cortical structures reflected a response which was similar to patterns seen in healthy human volunteers and metabolic maps of conscious rats. However, the use of isoflurane completely reversed such effects, causing widespread deactivations in the cortex and hippocampus. Conclusion: This study provides initial evidence for a drug-anesthetic interaction between ketamine and isoflurane that is very different from responses to -chloraloseketamine."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:13:03Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Anaesthesia;"},{"subject":"anesthesia;"},{"subject":"NMDA;"},{"subject":"ketamine;"},{"subject":"schizophrenia;"},{"subject":"Alfa-chloralose;"},{"subject":"isoflurane;"},{"subject":"phMRI;"},{"subject":"fMRI;"},{"subject":"BOLD;"},{"subject":"rat."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-05-12","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-05-12","titles":[{"title":"Differential Effects Of Anaesthesia On The Phmri Response To Acute Ketamine Challenge"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7844","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7844","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

In breast cancer, increased serum levels of YKL-40 are correlated with cancer metastasis and short survival, suggesting that serum levels of YKL-40 serve as a cancer biomarker. YKL-40 has the ability to stimulate vascular endothelial cell activation and suppress mammary epithelial cell differentiation, the pathophysiological events associated with tumor angiogenesis and poor differentiation. Neutralization of YKL-40 via an anti-YKL- 40 monoclonal antibody in animal trials demonstrates the ability of YKL-40 blockade to impede tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth, thus holding therapeutic promise for cancer therapy. Apart from these findings, substantial efforts are urgently required to decipher the key molecular mechanisms that mediate cancer metastasis and malignancy, which is expected to significantly offer translational value for breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

Study Design: Descriptive analysis of the available Australian government data on GP workforce and the Australian population between 2000 and 2010. Place and Duration of Study: Griffith University, Australia, between April and November 2011. Methodology: Australian GP workforce data for the 2000 to 2010 period was obtained from the Australian Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) website and population data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics website. A descriptive analysis of workforce trends using variables of interests such as overseas trained GPs, gender, age, professional services during the 11 year period was compared to population trends data. A new GP Workforce Index ratio (GPWIR = No. of GPs &lt;35yrs ÷ No. of GPs 35yrs to 64yrs of age) was derived from the data and calculated for each year of the study period. Results: The ratio of female to male GPs has increased by 35% and the percentage of overseas graduates has increased by nearly 35% in the 11 year period, an indication that the 0.12% number of GPs as a percentage of Australian population between 2000 and 2010 was only sustained by increasing the intake of foreign trained graduates. Vocationally registered GPs have increased by 20% in same period. The GP workforce index ratio (GPWIR) decreased from 0.223 in 2000 to 0.118 in 2007; this was followed by a slight increase from 0.120 in 2008 to 0.128 in 2010. Conclusion: The impact that an increase in the number of female GPs graduating from medical schools may have on the overall number of GP services available to the Australian population requires further study, since it was noted in the literature that female GPs are more likely to work part-time than male GPs. The GPWIR may be a useful indicator for evaluating the proportion of the &lt;35yrs old GPs as a proportion of overall GP workforce. Lower GPWIR may be associated with GP workforce shortage. GPWIR increased in the last 3 years of the study corresponding with an improvement in GP supply. In this study, the GPWIR proved to be more effective in predicting overall National GP workforce shortage trend than the DoHA GP per Population ratio of 0.71:1000 (Primarily used for regional and rural workforce shortage prediction). The Department of Health and Ageing may need to keep supporting rural and remote migration of GPs and also maintain an increase in the number of students entering medical schools."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:14:21Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"General practice;"},{"subject":"workforce;"},{"subject":"gender;"},{"subject":"aged care;"},{"subject":"GP shortage;"},{"subject":"overseas trained GPs;"},{"subject":"Australian general practice workforce."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-04-14","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-04-14","titles":[{"title":"The Mismatch Between Australian Population And General Practice Medical Workforce"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7846","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7846","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

A group of transmembrane proteins, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are mainly expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells, and play critical roles as PRRs (1). TLR signaling activates antigen-presenting cells that provoke innate immunity and establish adaptive immunity. TLRs can be activated not only by invading pathogens but also by certain danger or stress-associated endogenous molecules leading to the induction of sterile inflammation. Activation of TLRs is a first line defense of the immune system, leading not only to the activation and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to sites of infection, but also to the enhancement of antimicrobial activity (2). Each TLR has common effects, such as inflammatory cytokine induction or upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression. However, TLRs also have specific functions, exemplified by type I IFN-inducing ability. These immunoadjuvant effects are critical in antimicrobial immunity and also involved in manifestations of autoimmunity (1).

Specifically, brain-derived endothelial cells exhibit specialized properties that form the blood-brain barrier, an important structure that ensures homeostasis within the neural environment. Classic proteins associated with the blood-brain barrier include neurothelin (also known as CD147), neuroblast differentiation-associated protein, glucose transporter-1 and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Astrocytes are believed to be responsible for inducing the expression of blood-brain barrier proteins in brain endothelial cells. We evaluated the induction property of astrocytes in this study. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, both non-brain derived, were grown as co-cultures with human astrocytes or as monocultures for various periods. Blood-brain barrier marker mRNA levels were quantified using realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and protein localization was determined through immunofluorescence staining. Our results demonstrate expression of neurothelin, glucose transporter-1, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase mRNA in endothelial cells even in the absence of astrocytes. Co-culturing endothelial cells with astrocytes induced the expression of glucose transporter-1 and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase but not neurothelin. Immunofluorescence staining revealed expression and localization of neuroblast differentiation-associated protein at cell membranes of non-brain derived endothelial cells. Non-brain endothelial cells also showed glucose transporter-1, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and neurothelinimmunoreactivity in expected subcellular compartments.

Place and Duration of Study: The COMET trial was held in the Netherlands in fourteen Dutch hospitals from April 2009 until November 2011. Each hospital included two surgical and two general medicine nursing wards. Methodology: Prior to the introduction of the RRS, endpoints were collected for 5 months as part of a baseline assessment. The RRS was introduced in two steps. Initially, two tools were introduced during 7 months for early detection of the deteriorating patient: the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and for structured communication, the Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation (SBAR) tool. During the next 15 months the Rapid Response Team (RRT) was operational in addition to both the detection and communication tool. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis of trends in outcomes will be performed. The cost description will primarily focus on the program costs associated with training and education sessions and the time invested in all consultations originating from patient care on the study wards. Conclusion: The COMET study will provide evidence on the clinical outcomes and costs of the implementation of Rapid Response System.

However, increasing immigration from countries in which HBV is endemic has led to a wave of new HBsAg-positive subjects and their clinical impact needs evaluation. We compared the serological, clinical and epidemiological data relating to Italian and non-Italian subjects referred to a hospital in Northern Italy. Study Design: We retrospectively analysed the laboratory and clinical records of 488 subjects, including 107 (21.9%) non-Italians, in order to find data concerning clinical diagnoses, possible routes of infection, anti-HCV and anti-HDV antibodies. Results: The differences in gender distribution and mean age between the non-Italian and Italian patients were statistically significant (p&lt;.001). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of anti-HCV (2.9% vs 4.9%, p=.86) or anti-HDV (4.7% vs 5.0%, p=.89) co-infection, or the presence of HBeAg in chronic infection. There were no differences in the rates of acute (3.3% vs 5.1%; p=.68) or chronic infections (96.7% vs 94.9%; p=.68) infections, but there were statistically significant differences (p&lt;.001) in the rates of prevalent (54.5% vs 85.3%) and incident cases (45.5% vs 14.7%). The differences in the rates of asymptomatic (70.6% vs 34.9%) and symptomatic patients (29.4% vs 65.1%) were also statistically significant (p&lt;.001). The only significant differences in terms of risk factors related to transfusions (0% vs 6.8%; p=.04), and vertical/perinatal transmission (44.1% vs 6.8%; p&lt;.001). Conclusion: The non-Italian HBsAg-positive subjects were mainly women and younger than their Italian counterparts, and had a recent diagnosis. They were predominantly asymptomatic and probably considered themselves healthy and fit to emigrate.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Biology Department of Lomonosov Moscow State University; Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences; 2008 – 2011. Methodology: Mass spectrometric measurements of carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of corresponding maternal and fetal organs of gravid mice fed a monotonous diet. Results: Both the maternal and fetal organs (kidney, muscles, liver, myocardium, brain) of mice at the last term of gestation are enriched in 13C and 15N relative to food consumed. Isotopic composition of organs strongly depends on the number of bearing fetuses. The increase of fetuses’ number results in coordinated 13C depletion and 15N enrichment in both the maternal and fetal organs. Conclusion: The alteration of the δ13C and δ15N values reflects solely the metabolic restructuring during a pregnancy, since mice were fed the monotonous diet prior to conception and during gestation. Isotopic alterations develop as a reaction to the nutritional stress of the maternal organism under the trophic demands of fetuses. The protein replenishment is the most probable cause of isotope ratio changes. Under the controlled experimental condition the stable Isotope composition of biogenic elements can be used as integral indicators of metabolic efforts of the particular organismic structures.

No concensus has been reached regarding diagnostic criteria so far. The management of urachal carcinoma is controversial, too. In this case presentation, we reported a 47 year old female with urachal cancer and treatment approach discussed with published literature. Presentation of Case: A 47-year-old female patient was admitted with abdominal pain and hematuria. A soft mass was noticed under her navel. Computerized tomography revealed a tumor which is a cystic lesion arising from the urachus and a solid mass component at the urinary bladder dome. The tumor was removed by partial cycectomy. Histological examination showed urachal adenocarcinoma (colonic type and well differentiated), which had invaded the urinary bladder. The patient has been followed up without a recurrence for the next 6 months. Discussion: Urachal carcinoma is a rare type of, approximately 0.5 to 2%, bladder neoplasms. The pathogenesis of urachal tumours is not fully understood, so far. Currently, the most effective treatment of localized urachal cancer is cystectomy. It is unclear whether lymphadenectomy or chemotherapy is usefull for the patients with urachal carcinoma.

Genetic studies have provided the opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to IC pathology (i.e., the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) family, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)). Vitamin D also exerts its effect on IC through non-genomic factors, i.e., Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, mast cells and histamine, prostaglandins (PGs), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

A SEM analysis evaluated the topographic features of each bracket slot while an EDAX analysis was performed to analyse the constituting parts of each bracket. Results: As-received ORMCO brackets show more traces of plastic deformation than GAC brackets. On the contrary, pits, crevices and grain boundaries were observed on all as-received brackets. An increased plastic deformation and amount of scratches was noticed on ORMCO and GAC brackets after orthodontic treatment. Elemental analysis revealed that base and wing materials were not identical in GAC nor in Ormco brackets. In addition, both ORMCO and GAC brackets consist each of two parts assembled using a different brazing material. Conclusion: Both as-received brackets show different damage patterns on their slot surface. Increase of damage patterns was visualized after intra-oral use.

Study Design: Comparative study. Methodology: Several articles with topics referring to the 2008 ”Surviving Sepsis Campaign” guidelines in critically ill patients with varying effects on defined clinical endpoints were analyzed regarding the costs of additional treatment success (COATS). A simplified ICER = incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to assess COATS was expressed as the product of the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) and the difference in treatment costs per patient. Results: In publications with significant treatment effects enabling calculation of NNTs, calculating “COATS = NNT x delta costs per patient\", mean costs to avoid one additional death or morbidity could be defined. Considering the 95% confidence interval, estimated costs at minimum and maximum to reach distinct clinical endpoints could be expressed. In studies with no significant results, NNTs and COATS were tending to infinity. Conclusion: COATS based on NNT as a simplified ICER is an easy way for the physician at the bedside caring for individual patients to explicitly describe the amount of money which has to be spent to reach definable aims in the clinical setting in one additional patient, such as reduction of mortality or morbidity, or to reassess therapies without significant results. In contrast to COATS, ICER based on quality-adjusted life years may be necessary to perform calculation of the short-term and long-term costs for the community and the adequate allocation of health care resources."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:23:57Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Budget-related decisions;"},{"subject":"costs;"},{"subject":"intensive care units;"},{"subject":"incremental costeffectiveness ratio;"},{"subject":"morbidity;"},{"subject":"mortality;"},{"subject":"sepsis."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-10-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-10-31","titles":[{"title":"Costs Of Additional Treatment Success (Coats) Based On Numbers Needed To Treat (Nnt) Is A Simplified Calculation Method To Facilitate Physicians Medical Decisions With Regards To Monetary Costs"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7861","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:24Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7861","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Glucose was estimated at 30min, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h. In hypoglycaemic study, the extract was administered at doses of 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (bwt) doses. In fasting blood glucose study (FBG), diabetic Wister rats, 5 per group, received graded doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) of the extract or glibenclamide (10 mg/kg) or vehicle for 15 days. Blood was collected on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 for glucose estimation. Lipid profile was analyzed using modified enzymatic procedure. Insulin assay was done by Diagnostic Automation Kit and HbA1C by standard protocol. The studies lasted for three weeks. Results: The diabetic animals treated with the extract showed appreciable weight gain. In oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), RH seed extract and glibenclamide treated rats blood glucose significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased in the peak values and the area under curve after 4 h of oral load with decreased values of 48.3±1.0 mg/dL (63.3%) and 62.0±0.8 mg/dL (51.6%) respectively. The hypoglycaemic activity at 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (bwt) doses showed lowest plasma glycaemic decrease of 50.1% and 54.4% respectively after 8 h of oral administration. In FBG study, after 15 days of extract/glibenclamide treatment, the animals’ blood glucose exacerbated by alloxan challenge returned to normal glycaemia with glycaemic decrease of 87.2±2.3 (79.3%); 57.0±1.7 (86.3%) and 55.0±0.3 mg/dL (87.1%) respectively while glibenclamide showed a maximum glycaemic decrease of 167.4±1.1 mg/dL (60.1%). The tissue morphology of the extract treated showed significant beta cells survivor. The extract ameliorated dislipidaemia and exerted significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in plasma HbA1C while marked increase in plasma insulin level occurred.

Three different investigations were carried out. First transformation behaviour and transition temperatures were determined by differential scanning calorimetry, second a three point bending test was done to evaluate the mechanical properties and third scanning electron microscopy was performed on all samples to evaluate surface quality. Results: Absolute batch-to-batch differences in the investigated properties were all deviating from zero, although most differences were clinically acceptable. Significant interbatch differences in thermal properties were found in 4 wires. Mechanical interbatch differences were found remarkable for 5 wires. Percentage of elasticity showed a non-superelastic curve below a deflection of 1500 μm, which represents clinical small deflections. Surface topography showed also interbatch differences for 4 wires.

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Sports Medicine (Emergency Unit) between June 2009 and July 2010. Methodology: The study protocol included all athletes investigated for a prime evaluation to enter the criteria for this particular study. 30 BAV athletes (aged 25± 3) and 30 Tricuspid Aortic Valve (TAV) athletes, regularly trained were submitted to an echocardiographic exam. From the short axis LV view images, the circumferential strain, rotation, twist, distinguished in the endocardial and epicardial component at the basal and apical level, were calculated by the speckle tracking (ST) multi-layer approach. This is a special assisted mode (AHSTM, Aided Heart Segmentation) to track the LV Endo/Epi myocardial points. Results: In BAV only the epicardial (5.74±1.4) and endocardial (8.64±4.0) apical rotation are significantly higher than in TAV (p&lt;0.01) while the LV basal segments are at the lower limits. The endo/epi twist exams carried out in both BAV &amp; TAV result normal.

Methods: This study is an analytical cross-sectional study. Multistage sampling technique was used to obtain a representative sample and a structured selfadministered questionnaire was used to collect relevant information. Results: A total of 421 health care workers were interviewed, 5.2% reported percutaneous exposure to HIV infected blood or body fluids in the workplace in the last 6 months. Predictors of risk perception were working in public facilities [OR=2.28, C.I=1.26-4.15], male gender [OR=3.42, C.I=1.59-7.36] and training on infection control [OR=1.94, C.I=1.13-3.34]. Significantly more males [OR=2.33, C.I=1.12-4.94], those in public facilities [OR=5.85, C.I=1.97-19.48], urban facilities [OR=24.99, C.I=3.67-491.82] and those in tertiary facilities [[OR=17.96, C.I=6.04-59.99] reported a greater access to prophylaxis medication. Conclusion: The study concludes that male health care workers that are young, working in public facilities and have insufficient knowledge about HIV/AIDS have a high risk perception for HIV/AIDS while those in urban and public facilities especially tertiary facilities reported a ready access to prophylaxis medication. Uneven distribution of medication and other health care resources in Northern Nigeria and similar populations may contribute to increased casualty among the health care workers."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:27:45Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"HIV/AIDS infection;"},{"subject":"health care workers;"},{"subject":"occupational exposure;"},{"subject":"access to prophylaxis;"},{"subject":"risk perception;"},{"subject":"Northern Nigeria."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-01-19","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-01-19","titles":[{"title":"Occupational Exposure, Risk Perception And Access To Prophylaxis For Hiv/Aids Infection Among Health Care Workers In Northern Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7867","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:25Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7867","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

For depression research in patients, Beck's Depression Index (BDI) was used. Lower urinary tract symptoms of patients were evaluated by International prostatic symptoms score (IPSS) examination form and Erection quality was evaluated with International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF 5-15) examination form. According to evaluation results, patients were assigned as Group 0: Mild LUTS and no ED (IPSS&lt;7 - IIEF&gt;26), Group 1: Patients describing only moderate and severe LUTS, Group 2: Patients describing only ED (IIEF&lt;26), Group 3: Patients describing both LUTS and ED (IPSS&gt;7 - IIEF&lt;26). Results: A significant difference was observed between depression states of patients and their LUTS and IIEFs. Depression risk for the Group 3 was monitored to increase by 5.4 fold (p=0.012) according to the Group 0.

Presentation of Case: Two days after a bicycle accident causing severe TBI, a 23yo female developed a questionable seizure and received CBZ. Since then she required substitution of sodium. Six days after the accident she was extubated. Serum sodium was 123mmol/l. One day after transfer to the general ward, she was found comatose with a serum sodium of 114mmol/l. Cerebral CT showed diffuse cerebral edema. Electroencephalography did not record paroxysmal activity. After replacement of CBZ by levetiracetam, her condition markedly improved with a favourable outcome. Discussion and Conclusion: CBZ was made responsible for severe hyponatraemia in the presented case after exclusion of all other possible causes. Hyponatraemia may trigger the recurrence of cerebral edema after TBI. Hyponatraemia from CBZ may favourably respond to slow substitution of sodium with physiologic saline. CBZ for secondary prophylaxis of PTE may cause hyponatraemia, cerebral edema, and deterioration of pre-existing TBI. Replacement of CBZ by levetiracetame may resolve the condition.

However, development of toxicity may adversely affect patient outcome. We describe the outcome of 460 consecutive SS patients who were treated with an institutional hemodynamic protocol aimed at decreasing catecholamine toxicity. Study Design: Retrospective observational analysis. Place and Duration of Study: Multidisciplinary intensive care unit in a 460 bed hospital between January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2010. Methodology: Demographic data, premorbidities, admission Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, most aberrant laboratory data, highest dosages of norepinephrine (NE), dobutamine, milrinone, use of ß-adrenoreceptor blocking agents, hydrocortisone and arginine vasopressin (AVP), development of new-onset tachyarrhythmia and myocardial ischemia were analyzed from an electronic database. The institutional hemodynamic treatment protocol includes early administration of hydrocortisol and arginine vasopressin in addition to norepinephrine and aggressive treatment of hyperthermia (T&gt;38.5º). New onset tachyarrhythmia’s/tachycardia were treated using amiodarone and ß-adrenoreceptor blockers to decrease heart rate below 95bpm, respectively. Observed and SAPS-predicted mortality were analyzed for all patients and SAPS-quartiles (QI-QIV) of increasing disease severity. Results: Age, incidence of preexisting heart, renal disease, arterial hypertension, and MODS increased while body mass index significantly declined from QI to QIV. With increasing disease severity, patients received higher dosages of NE, steroids, AVP and milrinone. The incidence of tachycardic atrial fibrillation and myocardial ischemia increased from QI to QIV. Overall, there was no significant difference between the observed and SAPS II predicted mortality (p=0.2, Chi2-test). However, we observed a trend (-12, 2%) towards decreased mortality in QIII (p=0.07) and a significant decrease in hospital mortality (-19%) in QIV (p&lt;0.0001; Chi2-test).

Juss (Meliaceae) in rodents. Methodology: Anti-inflammatory activity of aqueous stem bark extract of K. senegalensis (AKS) was studied in different models. Effect of the extract in acute inflammation was tested in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and its effect in chronic inflammation was evaluated using cotton pellet-induced granuloma test. Croton oilinduced ear edema in mice was used to investigate the effect of the extract on topical inflammation. Antinociceptive property of AKS was evaluated using three models of nociception: hot-plate test, acetic acid-induced writhing in mice and formalin-induced paw licking in rats. Membrane stabilizing effect of AKS was tested in heat and hypotonicity-induced hemolysis. The mechanism of antinociceptive effect of the extract was evaluated by pre-treating rats with metoclopramide, a dopamine (D2) antagonist (1.5 mg/kg body wt.) and naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist (5 mg/kg body wt.). One hour after these treatments, the rats were given AKS (150 mg/kg p.o) and their reaction time in hot-plate was assessed. Free-radical scavenging activity of the extract was measured by decrease in the absorbance of 1, 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methanol solution. Results: The extract produced significant (P&lt;0.05) and dose-dependent inhibition of ear edema in mice. It also caused a significant (P&lt;0.05) reduction in granuloma formation and paw edema in rats. At concentration range of 125 - 500 μg/ml, AKS significantly (P&lt;0.05) protects the erythrocyte membrane against lysis induced by heat and hypotonic medium. It also significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the licking/biting time of the formalininjected rat paw in the early (19 - 51 % reduction) and late (13 - 57 % reduction) phases. The extract demonstrated significant (P&lt;0.05) antinociceptive activity in the hot-plate and writhing tests and exhibited good scavenging effect on DPPH free radical. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that Khaya senegalensis stem bark aqueous extract possesses anti-inflammatory activity and antinociceptive effect mediated via central and peripheral mechanisms.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Biology Department of Moscow State University; Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences; 2007–2011. Methodology: Mass spectrometric measurements of carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of jejunal epithelium and lens in 1- and 22-mo mice fed a monotonous diet. Results: The lenses are enriched in carbon and nitrogen as compared with intestinal epithelium (by 5.5% and 4.5% in 1-mo mice and 8.3% and 6% in 22-mo mice, respectively). The 15N content is also higher in lenses than in intestinal epithelium (8.97‰ vs. 7.62‰ in 1-mo mice, and 7.40‰ vs. 6.58‰ in 22-mo mice). The 13C content of lenses exceeds that of intestinal epithelium in 1-mo mice (-20.27‰ vs. -21.69‰), although 13C content is equal in 22-mo mice (-22.56‰ vs. -22.67‰). 15N content is depleted in the intestinal epithelium of 22-mo mice (-1.04‰), whereas 13C depletion (-0.98‰) is non-significant. 13C and 15N content in lenses is also significantly decreased in 22-mo mice (-2.29‰ and -1.57‰). Conclusion: The intestinal epithelium represents a structure with short-term isotopic memory lasting a few days, whereas the events of the organism’s entire lifetime are retained in lens isotopic memory. The difference of the parameters measured is evidently determined by structural contrast, metabolic rate, and rejuvenation modes of the tissues. The 15N depletion in both the intestinal epithelium and lenses, as well as 13C depletion in lenses of 22-mo mice might be considered as a sign of ageing. In contrast, the depletion of 15N in lenses of 22-mo mice should be considered primarily as a result of dilution of breastmilk isotopic signature that probably obscures age-related alterations of the organ. Comparison of isotopic compositions of these contrasting organs may be useful for physiological and ecological determinations."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:32:11Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"δ13C;"},{"subject":"δ15N;"},{"subject":"intestinal epithelium;"},{"subject":"lens;"},{"subject":"young and old mice."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-01-19","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-01-19","titles":[{"title":"Renewal Versus Retention: Isotopic Composition Of Intestinal Epithelium And Eye Lens"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7874","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:26Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7874","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

There is a growing concern about the rapid rise in the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to presently available antimicrobial agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence rate of MRSA and MRCoNS and their rate of resistance to different antistaphylococcal antibiotics used broadly for treatment. Out of the total 350 staphylococcal isolates from different clinical specimens 148 isolates (60.40%) were identified as MRSA by oxacillin screen agar method, and 46 isolates (43.80%) were screened as MRCoNS. All the MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance pattern by disc diffusion method for 16 different antibiotics. All the isolates of MRSA and MRCoNS were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance pattern of these isolates was high against penicillin. All the MRSA strains were resistant to penicillin and oxacillin (100%), followed by cephalothin and nalidixic acid (89.18%), cotrimoxazole (86.48%), erythromycin (85.81%), cephalaxin and cephradine (83.10%), levofloxacin (80.40%), imipenem (77.70%), gentamicin (76.35%), tetracycline (59.45%), ciprofloxacin (44.59%), chloramphenicol (18.24%) and rifampicin (10.13%). The MRCoNS strains also showed closely similar drug resistance pattern with 97.82% isolates being resistant to penicillin, followed by oxacillin (95.65%), cephalothin (86.95%), cephradine (82.60%), levofloxacin and nalidixic acid (80.43%), erythromycin, cephalaxin and imipenem (78.26%), cotrimoxazole (73.91%), gentamicin (69.56%), ciprofloxacin and tetracycline (63.04%), chloramphenicol (13.04%) and rifampicin (6.52%). However, all the MRSA and MRCoNS isolates, even those with very high oxacillin MIC (&gt;130 μg/ml) were uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. Chloramphenicol and rifampicin also showed excellent activity against methicillin-resistant isolates. Overall, data presented in this study indicated a slightly higher methicillin resistant rate in MRSA compared to MRCoNS strains. Multi-drug resistance rates in our MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were, 58.10 and 32.60%, respectively. Application of ß-lactamase production method revealed that 84% of MRSA and 87% of MRCoNS strains tested positive for the ß-lactamase production. This study indicated a high level prevalence of MRSA and MRCoNS strains resistance against widely used antimicrobial agents. An appropriate knowledge on the current antibiotic susceptibility pattern of MRSA and MRCoNS is essential for appropriate therapeutic regime determination."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T10:32:50Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"MRSA;"},{"subject":"MRCoNS;"},{"subject":"multidrug resistance;"},{"subject":"prevalence;"},{"subject":"antibiotic susceptibility;"},{"subject":"MIC."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-01-09","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-01-09","titles":[{"title":"Prevalence And Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern Of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus And Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci In Rawalpindi, Pakistan"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7875","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:26Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7875","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The mass was well defined, tender and firm but lacked other signs of inflammation such as redness or increased local warmth. Even the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were more in favor of a soft-tissue sarcoma. A diagnosis of pyomyositis was revealed when the trucut biopsy performed, yielded frank pus discharge. Discussion and Conclusion: This case illustrates a diagnostic quandary of a soft tissue mass. There may be a paucity of inflammatory signs in patients with an underlying immunocompromised state, masking an initial diagnosis of pyomyositis. Although softtissue sarcomas generally present as painless lumps, they can be painful especially with larger tumors that are increasing in size, further adding to a diagnostic dilemma.

Study Design: Cross sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Quito municipal schools during the academic year 2010- 2011. Methodology: We surveyed 6964 students (3254 males, 3710 females; age range 9 -17 years), previously classified by their body mass index. The self-administered questionnaire, completed in class time asked about breakfast habits, physical activity, type and stage of family. Results: 6939 students (99.6%) answered the question about usually eating breakfast. Of these, 5.4% (CI95% 4.87-5.94) reported not eating breakfast, this response being given by 6.8% of the girls (CI95% 6.0-7.6) and 3.7% of the boys (CI95% 3.1-4.4). Not eating breakfast was more common among the students aged 15 years (11.9% CI95% 8.2-15.7), 16 years (19.5% CI95% 12.8-26.3) and 17 years (17.9% CI95% 10.3-26.9). The crude OR for weight excess and not breakfasting 1.44 (CI95% 1.16-1.80) was strengthened after adjustment by age, sex, family type, family stage, sedentarism and health zone: OR 1.54 (CI95% 1.16-2.05). There was no significant association between eating a non-recommended breakfast and weight excess when adjusted by the mentioned variables. Conclusion: Not eating breakfast is associated with overweight and obesity, this problem being enhanced in girls who skipped breakfast twice as much as boys.

We investigated the association of patient HD treatment shift with continued survival, controlling for well-established HD-related mortality risk factors. Method: A 10-year (from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2010) follow-up retrospective cohort study was conducted among 120 ESRD patients who underwent HD at Kosin University Gospel Hospital either during a morning shift (n = 60) or an afternoon shift (n = 60). A variable comparison was conducted using a Chi-square test and t-test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Life table analysis was used to compare survival rates in the two treatment groups. Results: The mean survival rate of the morning-shift HD patients and afternoon-shift HD patients were not statistically different (mean survival, 61.1 months vs. 48.2 months; P = 0.139).

Results: The adherence to the 36 items varied between 0% and 95%. Besides the categories “adherent“ and “nonadherent“, additional categories “partially adherent“, “notapplicable“ and “unknown“ were used. None of the single items alone was essential for survival. Patients with septic shock on admission (n=68) had significantly higher SOFA scores (degree of organ dysfunctions) compared to patients developing septic shock in the ICU (n = 30).

As the results of a few spins of a roulette wheel cannot establish whether the wheel is honest (uniform value distribution), medical investigations of a few SIDS cases have not been able to uncover the mechanistic cause of death. We propose that this is because statistical analyses of large numbers of independent observations may be required to unmask the apparent probability processes that govern these quite different phenomena. The SIDS male fraction ~0.60 appears as a binomial probability sample characteristic of a condition caused by an Xlinked gene. The unique SIDS age distribution (minimum at birth, mode ~63 days, median ~94 days, falling exponentially to zero at ~41.2 months) appears as a probability sample from an underlying Johnson SB (4-parameter lognormal) distribution of ages. The presence of this lognormal distribution is prima facie evidence that a probability process is involved. Matching binomial and SB distribution equations to these physiological phenomena, we propose: The SIDS binomial gender distributions arises from an Xlinked recessive allele (q ≈ 2/3) non-protective against acute anoxic encephalopathy; and SIDS Johnson SB age distributions arise from such genetically susceptible infants having three independent risk factors: neurological prematurity (m + 0.31)-1 decreasing with age in months m; risk of respiratory infection increasing with age (41.2 - m)-1; and risk of physiological anemia rising and falling with age (2ᴨσ2)-1/2[exp(-0.5[(y-μ)/σ]2)] , where y = Log[(m + 0.31)/(41.2 - m)] = μ + σ z, μ is median of y, σ is standard deviation of y, with z a standard normal deviate.

Methodology: We describe the research methodology involved in an adapted Nominal Group Technique. We carried out the adapted NGT exercise in homogenous consultation workshops following the traditional approach which resulted in the generation of individual consensus lists of the important issues related to the posed question. In order to ensure that issues highlighted within different consultation workshops were maintained in the outputs we further developed the NGT approach, firstly by bringing common issues together by applying a thematization process and then further applying a second consensus building exercise based on the developed themes with a mixed population group. By supplementing consensus data with qualitative data collected during the research process, we further explored and justified the consensus reached. Results: We successfully applied the adapted NGT within the community pharmacy setting and were able to gain consensus regarding the positive and challenging aspects of patient- centred professionalism. Using qualitative data collected, we were able to describe in more detail the issues raised and the justification for the consensus reached. Conclusion: Using an adapted NGT, we describe how consensus was reached regarding the study question and how the basis for the consensus was explored. By applying this adapted NGT we were able to gain consensus regarding the relative importance of the issues under discussion across a mixed population group.

We also investigated the attitudes of narghile smokers to their habit, together with their willingness to stop NS; and finally their awareness to oral health and their perceptions about the harmful effects of NS. Study Design: The study was a cross-sectional survey whereby the sample was conveniently selected from all the faculties, institutes and centres of the University. Place and Duration of Study: University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan during July 2011. Methodology: Data were collected by allowing the participants to complete a preprepared questionnaire privately. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program. Results: Among the (96) participants, 24 ladies (25%) were smokers mostly (79.2%) of narghile. Demographic and social data of age, marital status, education level and number of children did not seem to affect smoking status. Friends and relatives were the main introducers and companions in narghile smoking (73.7%), and home was the main setting for the habit (68.4%). Whereas the hygienic practices related to narghile smoking were below the required level, narghile smokers reported a satisfactory level of oral health practices and were aware of the health risks associated with this habit. Conclusion: Narghile smoking is showing popularity among Jordanian educated working women who invariably have children. Social influences seem to be the major player in shaping women's smoking behavior, whereby close family and friends are the introducers and home is the favorable place for practicing the habit. Specific measures are needed to educate women, their husbands and children of the health hazards of narghile especially that children are adversely affected on different levels."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:13:03Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Jordanian;"},{"subject":"women;"},{"subject":"education;"},{"subject":"narghile;"},{"subject":"tobacco."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-27","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-27","titles":[{"title":"Narghile Smoking Among Jordanian Educated Working Women: Attitudes And Beliefs"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7890","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:28Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7890","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Physical Education and School Medical Science, University of Pernambuco 2009-11. Methodology: The study was conducted with 128 obese adolescents (76 girls [BMI=35.46±3.92] and 52 boys [BMI=33.70±2.88]), aged between 12 to 18 years old. Personal reasons for seeking weight loss treatment and barriers to losing weight were obtained by an individual semi-structured interview (8 questions) conducted by a psychologist. All individual interviews lasted approximately 20 min and were performed in a quiet room. Adolescents’ answers were semi-transcribed by the researcher and the content was anonymously analyzed in order to categorize the data. Results: The main reason for girls to start a weight loss program was to become healthy (39.47%), followed by to fit in clothes (30.26%), personal appearance (30.26%), and bullying (28.95%). Physical fitness (40.38%) was the most important reason to seek weight loss for boys, followed by to become healthy (36.54%), and bullying (25%). For both genders, the main barriers described were lack of self-control (47.37% - 36.54%), lack of social support (27.63% - 30.77%), and self-motivation (22.37% - 21.15%).

This study sought to evaluate a new reproductive medicine module for medical students. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Place and Duration of Study: Dublin, Ireland; 2008-2010. Methodology: A new educational module in reproductive medicine for upper-level medical students was initiated in 2008 at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). The module included reproductive endocrinology lectures, laboratory sessions, and direct observation of clinical consultations as a required component of an obstetrics and gynaecology rotation. Students were assigned to this module on the basis of random allocation by departmental administration. The current investigation used an anonymous questionnaire and a MCQ exam to measure academic performance and student acceptance of this module, at launch and again two years later. The first sampling was from the pilot class in 2008 and a second group was evaluated in 2010. No student was in both groups. Results: 42 of 66 students completed the evaluation in 2008, and 71 of 98 did so in 2010. Mean±SD medical student age and average examination scores were comparable for the two groups. In both samples, most students (95.5%) had no prior lectures on reproductive endocrinology, and most indicated improvement in their level of understanding after the module. Both laboratory and clinical features were scored highly by students. Conclusion: At present, there is no standardised medical student curriculum for reproductive medicine in Ireland.

However, the interrelatedness between the global responses to HIV/AIDS and NCDs hasn’t been systematically analyzed. Objective: To examine the similarities and differences between global responses to HIV/AIDS and NCDs. Methods: Using preliminary review of literature, we identified four major themes of the global response: Strategies, Systems, Intervention and Monitoring and Evaluation. Detailed review of purposively selected documents was then conducted under these four themes. Similarities and differences between the global response to HIV/AIDS and NCDs were then examined for each major theme using qualitative content analysis and interpretive synthesis. The findings were presented using narrative summaries, tables and boxes. Findings: HIV/AIDS and NCD strategies are similar in their general approach. However, HIV strategies are geared towards improving effectiveness and efficiency of programs while NCD ones focus on increasing access to and coverage of services and enhancing the priority accorded to NCDs. The organizational systems involved in the global response to both HIV/AIDS and NCDs involve multi-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and multilevel approaches that require global coordination mechanisms. The presence of many diseases in the NCD group means more complex coordination of the NCD response. HIV/AIDS and NCD interventions use similar models and approaches despite their differences in the technical content of the interventions and the demographic characteristics of the target population groups. The indicators and the target populations for monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS and NCD programs differ in their timeframe, level of specificity, and relative magnitude. Besides, the current NCD targets are voluntary. However, the Monitoring and Evaluation frameworks share important similarities in the methods used to generate and manage information. Conclusion: The similarities between the global responses to HIV and NCDs indicate that there are many processes that could be coordinated and/or integrated to improve synergy and efficiency. The differences, on the other hand, warrant the need for maintaining the integrity of the responses to each disease condition."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:13:54Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"HIV/AIDS;"},{"subject":"Noncommunicable diseases;"},{"subject":"global response."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-26","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-26","titles":[{"title":"Global Responses To Hiv/Aids And Noncommunicable Diseases: Analysis Of Similarities And Differences"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7893","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:28Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7893","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: This study was conducted among 281 pregnant women attending antenatal services at the hospital. Socio-demographic and obstetric information of the mothers was collected. Samples of cord blood smears of babies were stained with Giemsa and examined for malaria parasites. Results: Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite species. The prevalence of congenital malaria among newly born was 9.6%. This was more prevalent in women of Para 0 (5.3%) compared to other parities (4.3%) (P = 0.048). Malaria parasite was found in 4(16.7%) of preterm and 23(8.9%) of term deliveries (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Congenital malaria is still common in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.

Background: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma in most populations and is frequently associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). However, patients with POAG can also have IOP within the normal range and they are classified as having normal tension glaucoma (NTG) – most likely an independent entity. In NTG, the optic nerve head is just susceptible to normal IOP. Therefore, factors other than elevated IOP are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Although factors such as myopia, older age, vasospasm, ischemia and vascular insufficiency are indicated to be associated with the development of NTG, substantial percentage of NTG patients (21%) have a family history of glaucoma suggesting that these patients may have a genetic predisposition for developing NTG. Methodology: Using the keywords or phrases such as glaucoma, genetics, normal tension glaucoma, open-angle glaucoma and retinal ganglion cell, the literature search was carried out. Results: NTG is a genetically complex disorder and many genes have been reported to be associated with the development of glaucoma. However, none of them account for a substantial portion of patient population. A complex glaucoma pathogenesis may include interplay among several factors such as genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Therefore, an understanding of IOP independent mechanisms of development of NTG is important. Conclusion: NTG is relatively a less explored avenue of research. There has been paucity of research into the genetic basis of NTG."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:15:41Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Blindness;"},{"subject":"degeneration;"},{"subject":"ganglion;"},{"subject":"gene;"},{"subject":"glaucoma;"},{"subject":"retina."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-13","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-13","titles":[{"title":"Genetic Susceptibility To Normal Tension Glaucoma (Ntg)"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7899","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:29Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7899","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Presentation of Case: Due to the symptoms of a newborn and his family background, a peroxisomal panel was performed. There were high levels of very long chain fatty acids and abnormal peroxisomes. At 8 months the patient exhibited other complications, including progressive multi systemic deterioration, and at 15 months died of pneumonia. Discussion: Analysis of the patient’s fibroblasts provided evidence of a defect in the peroxisomes and in the oxidation of fatty acids, leading to a diagnosis of D-BP deficiency. Significant alterations were found in the genetic expression profile, with the greatest number of affected genes involved in neuronal functions, two implicated in peroxisomal biogenesis, and some others related to telomere protection and DNA repair. The child had a mixture of very short and normal length telomeres, a condition commonly observed in the elderly and in individuals with chronic degenerative diseases. Conclusion: The abnormal function of peroxisomes and altered gene expression found in the patient under study could explain the affected telomere length.

Study Design: Male individuals diagnosed with chronic periodontitis with and without smoking habits were enrolled in the study. The unstimulated whole saliva was subjected to H. pylori DNA detection using real time PCR. The percent presence of H. pylori DNA among the groups, were statistically compared. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Biochemistry and Department of Dentistry, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ group of Hospitals, Mumbai and Department of Microbiology, Sinhgad Dental College, Pune, between January 2010 and June 2010. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 males with severe chronic periodontitis (CAL≥5mm) were divided into two groups, Group I (n=30, mean age=44.2±5.88 yrs) with smoking habit, Group II (n=18, mean age 41.72±4.36yrs) without any smoking habit. Nonsmokers with slight chronic periodontitis (CAL&lt;3mm) were enrolled as controls, Group III (n=16, mean age 39.64±5.04 yrs). Periodontal status was evaluated by measuring gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL). Salivary samples were subjected to real time PCR for detection of H. pylori DNA. Result: Periodontal parameters were significantly different between Group I and II compared to Group III (P=.001). Overall, H. pylori was not detected in Group III (100% negative), whereas 5.5% of Group II and 13.3% in Group I patients showed presence of H. pylori. Chi-square test showed a significant difference (P=.003) between Group I and Group III however it was seen that there was an insignificant difference between Group I and Group II (P=.312) and between Group II and Group III (P=.186). Conclusion: The smokers with chronic periodontitis may be at a relatively higher risk of H. pylori presence in the oral cavity, than non smokers.

The understanding of the potential role of oxidative stress in the etiopathogenesis of autism would be very useful for earlier clinical, therapeutic or preventive strategies. Sample: To evaluate the redox status, we quantified the activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT), glutathione concentration (GSH) and markers of damage to biomolecules, malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and 8–hydroxy-2deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) in peripheral blood samples. Place and Duration of Study: Sample: Department of Neuropediatrics and Technology Science Division. International Center for Neurological Restoration (CIREN), Havana, Cuba. May 2011- June 2012. Methodology: We included 45 children with autism (36 males and 9 females, age-range from 3 to 11 years). 42 children of the same age were selected as a control group. The diagnosis of autism was made based on the criteria of autistic disorders as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Results: The total GSH content in autistic patients was significantly lower compared with the control group (0.24 ± 0.162 vs. 0.94 ± 0.115, respectively, p ≤ 0.001). Higher serum CAT, MDA and 8OHdG levels were found in children with autism compared with controls (CAT, 2.836 ± 0.479 vs. 0.689 ± 0.157, p ≤ 0.001; MDA 8.6 ± 0.5 vs. 1.76 ± 0.33 p ≤ 0.001, and 8OHdG 13.134 ± 1.33 vs.1.46 ± 0.326, p ≤ 0.001).

Study Design: Experimental study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Anatomy and Department of Pharmacology Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Ogbomosho Oyo State Nigeria between October and November 2011. Methodology: Forty adult male Swiss albino mice weighing between 20-25 mg were assigned into 4 groups A, B, C and D of ten mice each (n=10). Group A served as control and received normal saline while groups B, C and D received MSG daily at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg MSG /kg body weight (BW) dissolved in normal saline respectively for 28 days. On day 29 of the study animals were sacrificed, and the liver and kidneys were removed, weighed and processed for histological examination. Statistical analysis was by one way ANOVA followed by a posthoc test, and results were expressed as mean ±S.E.M. Results: MSG consumption resulted in a significant increase in the relative liver weight at 1.0 and 1.5 mg MSG /Kg BW and a relative increase in kidney weight occurring at 1.5 mg/Kg BW (P&lt;0.05). This was accompanied by a dose- dependent increase in body weight compared to control which failed to reach statistical significance. Liver and kidney histology indicated a loss of normal liver architecture with varying degrees of disorganization and apoptotic cell death compared to controls.

Morphological changes associated with apoptosis were observed using scanning electron microscopy. LC/MSMS analysis was used to determine the main flavonoids present in the plant extract. Results: Ducrosia flabellifolia ethanol extract showed selective antiproliferative activity against different cell lines. The highest activity was against MCF-7 cell line with IC50 value of 25.34 μg/mL, followed by Hep-2 cell line with IC50 value of 98.01 μg/mL. While the lowest activity was against Vero cell line with IC50 value of 98.01 μg/mL. The antiproliferative effect was exerted by inducing apoptosis as indicted by the presence of DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies in treated cancer cells. LC/MS-MS analysis revealed the presence of five flavonoids (quercetin, fisetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin) and their derivatives in the extract. Conclusion: The apoptosis inducing ability of Ducrosia flabellifolia ethanol extract validate the use of this plant in traditional medicine to treat cancer. The anticancer synergistic effect of Ducrosia flabellifolia compounds has broad implication for understanding the anticancer potential of plant natural products in vivo, where different compounds may act in concert to reduce tumor burden."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:18:41Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Flavonoids;"},{"subject":"anticancer;"},{"subject":"antiproliferative;"},{"subject":"plant extract;"},{"subject":"quercetin."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-28","titles":[{"title":"Jordanian Ducrosia Flabellifolia Inhibits Proliferation Of Breast Cancer Cells By Inducing Apoptosis"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7909","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:22:31Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7909","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Results: More females than males had problems with their body shape, where more females desired a thinner body size and vice versa for males. There was misperception of opposite sex’s perception of attractive body shape, where males chose a larger figure for attractive body shape of female compared to females themselves, and vice versa. Overweight students had significantly lower parental/peer acceptance, higher body shape satisfaction and hence lower body weight/shape anxiety, and made lesser body shape comparison compared to other counterparts.

The aim of this report is to present a case of VF recurrence induced by chest compressions (CCs) following successful defibrillation of VF and to discuss the possible mechanisms that could be linked to this observation. Case Presentation: A 57 year-old female suddenly collapsed and upon initiation of CPR, VF was observed. The patient was treated with 6 CPR-defibrillation cycles according to the current guidelines, after which she converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), but died following 9 in-hospital days. The monitor rhythms strips throughout resuscitation reveal restoration of NSR after the 4th defibrillation, yet CCs were resumed 1.3 seconds post DC shock and refibrillation closely followed. The first compression was timed exactly on the peak of the first post-shock sinus beat followed by refibrillation. Discussion: possible mechanisms for the observed phenomenon include: creation of a long-short activation sequence by electric stimulation of the ventricles leading to VF recurrence, sudden stretch during a vulnerable window, which is determined by repolarization inhomogeneity and activation of mechano-sensitive ion channels, reperfusion arrhythmias (commonly ventricular tachycardia and PVCs) during restoration of coronary perfusion in acute myocardial infarction.

This is commonest in the lumbar spine. Objectives: To audit lumbo-sacral spine radiographs for spondylolisthesis with emphasis on localisations, sex distribution, types and grading. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was carried out from1st May, 2011 to 21st June, 2012 in Radiology Department, University of Uyo teaching hospital, Uyo, Nigeria. Recruited patients were referrals for lumbo-sacral radiography irrespective of indications. Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the lumbo-sacral spine were taken under standardized conditions. Radiographs with spondylolisthesis were identified and analysed statistically using computer SSPS 13. Results: 249 Patients were studied (132 Males and 117 females). 9.24% (n=23) of the studied population had 25 individual vertebral displacements. 82.61% (n=19) of these patients were females and 17.39% (n=4) were males (female to male ratio - 4.75:1). The mean age for males with vertebral displacement was 44.5 (S.D=10) while the mean age for females was 44.5 (S.D=15.81). The commonest level of vertebral involvement was L4 on L5. This was seen in 56.52% (n=13) of patients with positive cases of spondylolisthesis. This was followed by L5 on S1 with 30.43%. 82.61% of patients had grade 1 displacements. Degenerative spondylolisthesis was the commonest type (52.17%), followed by isthmic type (21.74%), uncategorised (17.39%) and traumatic spondylolisthesis (8.70%).

Study Design: A cross-sectional study involving 460 women aged 15-49 years who were currently pregnant or had their most recent birth within the previous five years prior the survey was conducted using a two-stage sampling technique. Place of Study: Rural and semi-urban communities in Ondo State, Nigeria. Methodology: We administered semi-structured interviewer questionnaire. Knowledge was classified as good if knowledge score is higher or equal to the mean score obtained from this study and poor if otherwise. A 5-point likert scale was used to measure respondents’ perception. Respondents with scores less than the mean perception score from this study were classified as having negative perception and positive if otherwise. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests and logistic regression model were used for data analysis and significance level was set at P = .05. Results: Mean age, knowledge score and perception score of the respondents were 29.8±7.3 years, 6.0±1.2 and 29.6±6.0 respectively. Overall, 95.4% had utilized ANC facilities. Highest proportions (55.0%) of those utilizing ANC were aged 20- 30years.About two fifth (40.8%) reported that free ANC services was the main reason for choosing public ANC facilities. Almost two-third (63.0%) of the respondents had good knowledge of ANC, while about 35.9%had positive perception towards free ANC services. Higher utilization of ANC services was observed among married or cohabiting women than the singles and widows (P = .04).

For this purpose, proliferation capacity, phenotypic properties, differentiation characteristics and gene expression profiles were analyzed and compared with mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) of the human. Methods: Stem cells isolated from PT and BM were analyzed by flow cytometry, RTPCR, Real Time-PCR, and immunocytochemistry. Both cell lines were directionally differentiated towards adipogenic, osteogenic and neurogenic cell lineages. Results: The isolated hPT-SCs share similar characteristics of hBM-MSCs by immunophenotypic, histological and molecular analyses. Both cells were shown to differentiate successfully into adipogenic and osteogenic cell lines. Embryonic stem cell markers Pou5F1, Zpf42, FoxD3, Sox2 and Nanog were also expressed beside 5 fold higher telomerase activity in hPT-SCs that could indicate the regenerative ability of the human parathyroid gland. The osteogenic cell markers were expressed by hPT-SCs, which transformed efficiently into osteogenic cell lines, both at the level of genes (BMP2, BMP4, BGLAP, Coll11a1, Runx2, Sparc) and of proteins (BMP2, BMP4, Osteocalcin, Osteonectin, Osteopontin). Higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity indicating osteogenic differentiation was determined in hPT-SCs from secondary hyperparathyroidism patients. Conclusion: PT-SCs might responsible for the calcified parathyroid glands and other ectopic calcifications including the vascular ones, observed in the secondary hyperparathyroidism cases, beside parathyroid hormone-dependent hypercalcemia leading diffusion of calcium phosphate precipitation in tissues."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:49:06Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Hyperparathyroidism;"},{"subject":"parathyroid gland;"},{"subject":"stem cells;"},{"subject":"telomerase activity and"},{"subject":"osteogenic differentiation."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-28","titles":[{"title":"Stromal Stem Cells From Parathyroid Glands Of Patients With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Demonstrate Higher Telomerase Activity And Osteogenic Differentiation Ability Than Normal Bone Marrow Derived Stromal Stem Cells"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7917","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:20:56Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7917","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: The translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire was performed according to the international standards. The following aspects of the questionnaire were evaluated: construct validity, using factorial analysis, and discriminant capacity, by comparing Work Ability Index scores across variables likely to be related with work ability, like absenteeism; criterion validity, by determining the correlation between self-reported health and Work Ability Index score; and reliability, using Kendall’s tau b coefficient to determine the internal consistency of the questionnaire. Results: A two-dimensional structure model, interpreted as “subjectively estimated work ability” and “ill-health related ability” of the instrument fits better our study population with some of the subscales load on both dimensions. Good discriminating properties of the tool with sickness absence, education level and high criterion validity using dimensions of health status, were evident.

The aim of this systematic review was to present the literature on pharmacological interventions against sleep disturbances and use of hypnotics in patients with breast cancer. We wanted to study patients both in the perioperative period as well as when they were receiving oncological (medical) treatment. Study Design: Systematic review. Methodology: According to the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was performed on May 10th 2012 in Pubmed and Embase. Primary outcomes were pharmacological interventions against sleep disturbances. No restriction on publication status was made. Only articles in English were included. Case reports and studies with less than ten patients were excluded. Results: Five studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study investigated pharmacological intervention in the perioperative period and showed that treatment with triazolam significantly improved sleep three consecutive nights after surgery. Two studies investigated patients undergoing endocrine oncological treatment. The studies showed that zolpidem combined with an SSRI/SNRI improved sleep in patients having hot flashes, and that hypnotics were prescribed significantly more often in patients undergoing endocrine treatment compared with healthy patients not receiving endocrine treatment. Two studies investigated patients receiving chemotherapy. The studies showed that hypnotics were prescribed to almost every second patient. Prior users of hypnotics and patients with a psychiatric diagnosis were more likely to take hypnotics during chemotherapy. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances occur frequently in patients with breast cancer indicated by the high prevalence of hypnotic use. It therefore is of concern that only few clinical trials exist on pharmacological intervention against sleep disturbances in the different treatment time periods. At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend one single pharmacological intervention in this patient group."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:49:59Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Breast cancer;"},{"subject":"sleep disturbances;"},{"subject":"hypnotics."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-27","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-27","titles":[{"title":"Hypnotic Use For Sleep Disturbances In Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7920","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:20:56Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7920","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

There is a need to evaluate these contradicting findings in our environment. Aim: To examine the relationship between intraocular pressure and body mass index (BMI) in a population screened for glaucoma at the University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria Materials and Method: This study was part of a one-day screening exercise for glaucoma at the University of Port Harcourt. All subjects participated with willful consent. Demographic data included age, sex, race and occupation. Height was measured with a wall-mounted tape and weight with a bathroom scale. Intraocular pressure was measured with Perkins hand-held applanation tonometer and funduscopy was carried out with a direct ophthalmoscope. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (Weight/Height2). Results: A total of 491 subjects were screened. There were 230 males (46.8%) and 261 females (53.2%). About 50% (n=246/491) of the participants had normal BMI, 28.7%(n=141) were overweight while 17.7%(n=87) were obese. The mean BMI was 25.39 ± 4.82. Most obese participants were females (n= 63/87; 72.4%) while most males had normal body weight (n=131; 53.2%). The relationship between BMI and gender was statistically significant (P=0.00). The mean intraocular pressure of all participants was 16.21±5.01mmHg. Most overweight (88.6%; n=241/272) and obese persons (n=149; 87.6%) had normal IOP. There was however no statistically significant relationship between BMI and IOP (P=0.473; r2 =0.02).

Study Design: It is a prospective, observational, case control study carried out from 1st till 31st July 2012 in a medical centre of Salvation Army, in Kinshasa, DR Congo, mostly giving low cost diabetic healthcare. Post menarche, non pregnant and non lactating diabetic women aged from 15 years up to 35 years attending a routine monthly visit were consecutively recruited after consent. The controls were enrolled consecutively after each case among non diabetic women. Fasting plasma glucose for patients and random plasma glucose values for controls were measured. Gynecologic antecedents including menstrual irregularities were recorded. Statistical Analysis: Mean values are presented with standard deviations. Chi-square and student’s t-test were used for comparison of characteristics’ proportions and means of patients and controls. Odds ratio was used to seek for influence of diabetes on disturbances. Results are given with 95% confidence interval (CI), and p&lt;0.05 as significant. Results: During the period of study 35 patients and 35 controls were recruited. The mean glucose blood concentration of patients (232.5±4.8mg/dL vs 82.7±15.6mg/dL) is a marker of overall poor diabetes control. Late menarche was significantly more frequent in cases than in controls (p=0.01; CI=8.5-48). As of menstrual troubles, differences appeared for amenorrhea (p=0.000; CI=23.3-62.5) and spaniomenorrhea (p=0.03; CI=2.4-43.3), more frequent among patients. Conclusions: Mean blood glucose concentration of diabetic women of the study averages 232.5mg/dL. Amenorrhea and spaniomenorrhea that characterize cycle disturbances in these patients could thus be regarded as need for better control of the illness and good contraception. Such a suboptimal diabetes management is expected to increase the burden of the illness not only in terms of chronic complications but also in reproductive health of the community."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:50:34Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Menstrual cycle;"},{"subject":"disturbances;"},{"subject":"diabetic women;"},{"subject":"Congo."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-27","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-27","titles":[{"title":"Menstrual Cycle Disturbances In Diabetic Women In Kinshasa, Drc"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7922","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:20:56Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7922","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Retrospective. Place and Duration of Study: Pediatric Gastroenterology Division, Texas Children’s Hospital over 24 months (Jan 1, 1998 –Dec 31, 1999). Methodology: Children with DEI at Texas Children’s Hospital over 24 months were identified. Clinical symptomatology was analyzed by a retrospective medical record review. Two pediatric pathologists re-evaluated all biopsies. Follow-up was done by contacting the patients 12-36 months after the initial diagnosis. Results: Total number of GI biopsies that included duodenum over the study period was 1145 biopsies. Out of 1145 cases, 780(68%) cases indicated eosinophilic infiltrates (EI) at some GI site. Out of these, 287(37%) cases had DEI. Mean age was 10.4 years. (F: M .2:1). Race: 197(79%) Caucasians, 37(15%) Latin Americans, 9(4%) African Americans and 6(2%) Arabs. Clinical symptomatology: 249 records were available for evaluation. 69.9% complained of abdominal pain, 55% had vomiting, 34.9% with diarrhea and 32.9% had weight loss. 105 patients were available for follow up; 38% continued to have abdominal pain, 15.2% with vomiting, 10.5% diarrhea and 7.6% had a persistent weight loss. Peripheral eosinophilia was present in 35.2%. Medical treatment included proton pump inhibitors (57.0%), H2-blockers (55.4%), steroids (26.5%), and elemental diet (9.6%). Histopathology: 6% had &lt;10 eosinophils /hpf, 51.8% with 10-20eos/hpf, and 42.2% with &gt;20 eos/hpf. There were no significant differences in the number of eos/hpf between those with or without a specific symptom. Fourteen children (5.6%) subsequently developed IBD; their histopathological data did not differ from the rest.

Methodology: TW01 and TW01-LMP1 cells were treated with cytokines. MicroRNAs were isolated from treated and untreated TW01/TW01-LMP1 cells and were subjected to RT-PCR array of 88 cancer-related microRNAs. The threshold cycle (Ct) data were analysed and fold-change in the level of gene expression was calculated based on ΔΔCt using two endogenous controls, SNORD 47 and SNORD 44. Data obtained from each treatment were compared with the data obtained from the respective control group (untreated TW01/ TW01-LMP1). Results: TGF-β1 down-regulated miR-143 in TW01 NPC cells. In TW01 cells that expressed the EBV LMP1 gene (TW01-LMP1), approximately 97% of the 88 miRNAs were up-regulated by TGF-β1. Among them was miR-181c a well-known repressor of NOTCH2/4 and KRAS and has important role in cell differentiation. IL-6 up-regulated approximately 65% of the miRNAs in TW01 cells but in less than four-fold. In TW0- LMP1 cells, eight miRNAs; namely, miR-15b, miR-155, miR-16, miR-215, miR-23b, miR-25, miR-9 and miR-98 were significantly up-regulated by IL-6. Among these, miR- 15b, miR-155 and miR-25 had been reported to be elevated in NPC tissues.

Study Design: Animal model was used for this study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of biochemistry and department of Anatomy, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso. January, 2012 to October, 2012. Methodology: We included 8 white rabbits which were divided into 2 groups, 1 (control i.e. rabbits given normal diet) and 2 (rabbits given standard diet plus 0.2% cholesterol and 0.6% groundnut oil i.e. atherogenic diet). Feeding was for 8 weeks. The minerals were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer; lipids and lipoproteins were determined spectrophotometrically while the effects of atherosclerosis on heart and kidneys were determined chemically and histologically. Results: The results showed elevated serum concentrations of total cholesterol (4.05%), triglyceride (28%), high density lipoproteins (12.17%), very low density lipoprotein (70%) in atherosclerotic group when compared with control. Atherosclerosis caused decreased serum concentrations of copper (13.88%), manganese (23%), iron (26.46%) in atherosclerotic group when compared with control. Atherosclerosis induced elevated serum concentrations of zinc (47.34%), chromium (37.21%), calcium (72.04%) and magnesium (125.13%). Except for chromium, significant positive correlations were observed between serum cholesterol and trace elements. Induction of atherosclerosis resulted in impaired renal function shown by elevated concentrations of urea (34.80%) and creatinine (147.54%). Renal histology showed cellular necrosis of the epithelial squamous cells. In the aorta and brachiocephalis of the atherogenic diet fed rabbits, there were large number of smooth muscle like cells and focal aggregation of foam cells resulting in intima thickness.

We review our finding of a long non-coding RNA (designated Heg) in mononuclear cells (MNC) and regulation of TSH receptor autoantibodies (TRAb). Results: The Heg RNA transcript in MNC is negatively correlated with TRAb in patients with early and untreated Graves’ disease. In treated patients and in controls Heg correlated negatively with CD14 mRNA. Transfection studies with fragments of Heg added to MNC (exogenous Heg) decreased CD14 mRNA in MNC and increased gene expression of RIG-I, TLR7 and IFN-γ. Heg is likely to activate TLR7 receptors. CD14 is a co-receptor of TLR7. Decrease in gene expression of CD14 after Heg is a sign of differentiation of MNC to dendritic cells. This may reduce surface expression of CD14, cytokine responses and the responsiveness to TSH receptor antigens. Thus the relationship between TRAb and lnc Heg RNA is most likely explained by receptor crossinterference. Cdk1 mRNA (an index of cell cycle activity) is positively related with TRAb. Cdk1 mRNA and TRAb but not Heg decreased significantly during antithyroid treatment. Cdk1 decreased to values below normal.

Methods: The study was conducted over the period 1995-2008 at the tertiary Dermatology and Anatomical Pathology referral centers of the University of Pretoria. The clinical and pathological features of confirmed cases were assessed. Sixty four H&amp;E; stained sections from skin lesions distributed over different body areas were examined with regard to 16 histopathological parameters for the evidence of follicular differentiation and features useful in distinguishing trichoepithelioma from basal cell carcinoma.

Results:Trichoepithelioma multiplex was an uncommon diagnosis (20 patients). African patients were preponderant (16 vs.4 Caucasians) with slight male predominance (11 vs. 9 females). Sporadic cases prevailed (15 vs. 5 familial cases).A wide variation in the severity of the clinical presentation was observed, young black males and familial cases being more severely affected. The face was involved in all cases (30 biopsies), followed by the scalp and back (13 biopsies each) and the neck (8 biopsies).

This study assessed the level of awareness, basic knowledge and management of hypertension and CV risk factors among people living in rural south western Nigeria. Methods: A population based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Egbeda local government area of Oyo State, Nigeria. A structured questionnaire was used to interview 2000 subjects in order to assess knowledge of various aspects of modifiable CV risk factors. Results: The commonest source of medical information was the family/friend/opinion leaders of trusted groups in 1198(59.9%), the media (including radio, public enlightenment programmes, and newspapers) in 492(24.6%), and the doctor/nurse/health worker in 183(9.1%) of the respondents. The overall knowledge of CVD and its risk factors was poor. About 56% of the respondents could not identify a single risk factor. Of those who were able to, only a few could correctly identify the relationship between CV risk factors and CVD with some misconceptions. . We found that subjects who had more years of formal education, a positive family history of CVD, and self reported history of diabetes mellitus were more likely to have a good level of knowledge of hypertension and other CV risks when adjusted for age, gender and marital status. Conclusion: Our study confirms a limited knowledge and misconceptions of CVD and its risk factors in this population. Early detection and preventive practices were significantly lacking due to these gaps in Knowledge. There is an urgent need to design and implement culturally appropriate public awareness, health educational and health promotional programmes about CV risk factors and CVD for this community which can be adapted for other rural population in the country."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:53:57Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Cardiovascular disease;"},{"subject":"cardiovascular risk factors;"},{"subject":"hypertension;"},{"subject":"knowledge;"},{"subject":"community-based study;"},{"subject":"Nigeria."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-13","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-13","titles":[{"title":"Knowledge Of Hypertension And Other Risk Factors For Heart Disease Among Yoruba Rural Southwestern Nigerian Population"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7933","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:20:57Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7933","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Hence, screening of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 genes is taken up to evaluate the genetic correlation of these genes in Long QT patients of Indian origin. A total of 33 Long QT Syndrome patients and 100 healthy subjects were enrolled for the present study. PCR-SSCP protocol was utilised for screening of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 genes followed by In-silico and statistical analysis. The clinical profile of the Long QT syndrome patients in our study revealed a higher percentage of females with the mean age also being higher in females when compared to males. The two variations (S546S and IVS13+36A&gt;G) in KCNQ1 and the S38G polymorphism in KCNE1 gene were identified and their association with Long QT syndrome is being reported for the first time in Indian population. S546S is located in the KCNQ1 C terminus close to this domain and IVS13+36A&gt;G is located in the intronic region in close proximity to the coding region for C-terminal domain; these may therefore affect the functional protein through non-assembly. S38G leads to a substitution of serine to glycine at 38th amino acid position (S38G) in the transmembrane domain of KCNE1. Our study reports compound heterozygosity/genetic compound ofS546S and IVS13+36A&gt;G of KCNQ1 gene.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of overexpression of wild-type TGIFLX (wt-TGIFLX) on LNCaP, human prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Study Design: As a prospective study, we used adenovirus expression system for evaluation of TGIFLX expression effects on mammalian cells. Place and Duration of Study: Medical Genetics Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), between December 2009 and July 2012. Methodology: We cloned entire coding sequence of TGIFLX gene into adenovirus and subsequently LNCaP cells were transfected with the recombinant virus harboring TGIFLX cDNA or control. The TGIFLX expression was confirmed by microscopic analysis and RT-PCR technique. Following molecular cloning and characterization of TGIFLX transcription factor, we then studied the effects of overexpression of TGIFLX in LNCaP cells on mRNA expression of BAX and BCL2 genes. Results: Our results showed that overexpression of TGIFLX downregulated BCL2 gene (P&lt;0.05) and upregulated BAX gene (P&lt;0.05) at transcript level. Our results suggested that TGIFLX could be a tumor suppressor gene and might be involved in initiation and/or development.

Methods: Participants were 778 men and 286 women from four years of SWAB training. Before SWAB training, the subjects were administered a Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) (2-minute maximal effort sit-ups and 1.5 mile run) and functional movement screening (FMS) test. Height and weight were measured and, gender, age and ethnicity were obtained from administrative records. Training-related injuries were compiled from student medical records. The diagnosis, body part location, disposition, and limited duty days were recorded for each clinic visit. Results: During the 8 weeks of SWAB training, 23.8% of the women and 18.4% of the men were injured at least once. Compared to the men, the odds of an overall injury among women was 1.39 (95% confidence interval= 1.00-1.92). The odds of an overuse injury among women was 1.72 (95%confidence interval= 1.21-2.43) times higher than the men and the number of limited duty days for overuse injuries was also higher among the women (p &lt;0.01). Independent risk factors for injuries among both men and women included lower aerobic fitness and lower functional movement screening scores. Conclusions: Female USCGA cadets were at higher risk of injuries, especially overusetype injuries. Specific factors that put cadets at higher injury risk included lower aerobic capacity and inefficient movement strategies. Future injury studies should focus on females, aerobic fitness, and movement strategies. Prevention strategies should be tested to reduce injuries to limit lost training time."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:55:42Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Physical fitness;"},{"subject":"functional movement screening;"},{"subject":"sit-ups;"},{"subject":"1.5-mile run."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-11","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-11","titles":[{"title":"U.S. Coast Guard Academy Injury And Risk Factor Study"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7939","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:20:58Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7939","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Comparison of independent but concomitant arms of a randomized investigation on GPI. Place and Duration of Study: The Sant’ANna TIrofiban Safety study (SANTISS www.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00566891) was an open-label investigator-initiated single centre registry at Sant’Anna Hospital, Catanzaro, during a 5-year enrollment period. Methodology: We considered 726 ACS patients with PCI under either triple (aspirin, clopidogrel including high-dose tirofiban) or double (aspirin and clopidogrel) antiaggregating drugs (AAD). Serum creatinine levels, creatinine clearance (CrCl, using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, using both MDRD and CKD_EPI formulas) were used as continuous co-variables. Cox’s proportional hazards model tested the multivariable contribution of covariates all fitted simultaneously (forced method) in order to predict the incidence of 1-year cumulative ischemic events (CIE). Results: There were 69 (9.5%) 1-year CIE. Incidences were 5.4, 9.8 and 13.4% (P=0.012) in CrCl tertiles 1 (96-216 ml/min), 2 (73-95 ml/min) and 3 (15-72 ml/min), respectively. Compared to CrCl, the percentile distributions of eGFR, by MDRD or CKD_EPI formulas were similar: all were comparable and significant predictors multivariately (p&lt;0.001) of long-term CIE. The presence of diabetes (hazard ratios, HRs 1.84-1.91), intra aortic balloon pump (HRs 3.59-4.03), and thrombolysis (a protective factor) by tenecteplase (HRs 0.30-0.30) were further significant risk factors. With highdose tirofiban there was a 20% lower but not statistically different incidence of 1-year CIE.

Study Design: Descriptive and survival. Place and Duration of Study: Pathology Division at National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 1992-1996. Methodology: Population: 348 women patients with invasive ductal carcinoma without lymph node metastasis. Analyzed variables: age, treatment, surgery type, tumor size, skin involvement, histological grade, vascular invasion, estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER-2, Ki-67 and p53. Statistical analysis performed: Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log rank test, and multivariate Cox models. Results: 27% of the studied women were categorized as TNBC and 73%, as non-TNBC. The former showed higher frequency of age &lt;50yr, preoperative chemotherapy, tumors &gt;5cm, high grade, vascular invasion, and positive p53, (P=.05). Ten-year OS among TNBC patients was 61.6%, and 70.1% for non-TNBC patients (P=.058). Survival was higher in TNBC patients treated with partial surgeries, tumors 5cm, without skin involvement, low grade, and Ki-67 negative (P=.05). Among non-TNBC patients, higher survival was observed in patients without skin involvement, low grade, no vascular invasion, and p53 negative, (P=.05). Cox modelization showed a 2-fold higher death risk for TNBC patients aged ≥50yr, about 2.5-fold higher risk related to preoperative chemotherapy, high grade tumor and skin involvement, and a 3.0-fold higher risk for Ki- 67 positive patients (P=.05). For non-TNBC patients, a 2.0-fold increased death risk was verified in patients with skin involvement and vascular invasion (P=.05). Conclusion: TNBC patients showed a worse prognosis and survival when compared to non-TNBC patients. A worse 10-yr survival among TNBC patients was associated with age ≥50yr, preoperative chemotherapy, skin involvement, high histological grade, and Ki- 67 positive tumors. For non-TNBC patients, the worst prognosis was related to skin involvement and vascular invasion.

The objective of this study was to explore pharmacological basis for its use in gastrointestinal disorders. Materials and Methods: Crude aqueous (Bl.Aq) and methanolic (Bl.Meth) extracts of B. lycium were studied on isolated gut preparations of rabbit (jejunum) and guinea pig (ileum) by using in-vitro techniques. Tissues were mounted in tissue organ baths assembly containing physiological salt (Tyrode's) solution, maintained at 37ºC and aerated with carbogen, to assess the spasmogenic and spasmolytic effect and to find out the possible underlying mechanisms. Responses were measured on BioScience Powerlab data acquisition system by using isotonic transducers. Results: Phytochemical analysis indicates the presence of alkaloids, tannins and saponins in Bl.Aq and Bl.Meth. when tested on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum, showed a dose-dependent spasmogenic effect at lower concentration (0.01-0.1 mg/mL) and (0.01-0.03 mg/mL), which was followed by spasmolytic effect at higher concentration (0.3-1.0 mg/mL) and (0.1-0.3 mg/mL) respectively. Pretreatment of the tissue with atropine (0.1 μM) partially suppressed the contractile effect. Bl.Aq and Bl.Meth caused complete inhibition of high K+ (80 mM)–induced contraction at 0.3 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL respectively and also produced a dose-dependent (0.01-0.03 mg/mL) rightward shift in the Ca++ concentration-response curve, similar to verapamil. When tested in bolus protocol on isolated guinea pig ileum, Bl.Aq and Bl.Meth caused a dosedependent spasmogenic effect at 0.01-0.1 mg/mL. Pretreatment of tissue with atropine (0.1 μM) partially suppress the contractile effect. Conclusions: Results indicate that spasmogenic effect was partially mediated through cholinergic activity and spasmolytic effect was mediated through calcium channel blocking activity (CCB), explain its traditional uses in diarrhea, intestinal cramps and other gastrointestinal intestinal disorders."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:56:35Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Berberis lycium;"},{"subject":"spasmogenic;"},{"subject":"spasmolytic;"},{"subject":"cholinergic;"},{"subject":"Ca++ antagonist."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-11","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-11","titles":[{"title":"Rationalization Of Traditional Uses Of Berberis Lycium In Gastrointestinal Disorders"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7942","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:20:59Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7942","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Prospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pneumonology, First Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, Department of Radiology Medicine, between June 2009 and May 2011. Methodology: Ten patients who met criteria for APS (5 primary and 5 secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus) were prospectively identified. All patients underwent chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and functional assessment including spirometry and 6-minute walking distance. Patients were free of respiratory symptoms. HRCT scans were evaluated for presence of air-trapping, subpleural reticular pattern, centrilobular nodules of ground-glass opacity, cysts, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation and pleural effusion. Extent of air-trapping was estimated based on a HRCT scoring system. Results: All patients exhibited radiological and functional pattern compatible with smallairway disease, irrespective of smoking status. HRCT findings were negatively correlated with reduced levels of maximum midexepiratory flow (MMEF) 25/75%pred (r=-0.936, p&lt;0.0001). Subpleural basal reticular pattern consistent with fibrosis was seen in 3 patients. Thin-walled cysts and upper-lobe hazy micronodular pattern were detected in 4 patients.

Nerve biopsy disclosed diffuse loss of myelinated fibers, reduced diameter of non-myelinated fibers, and fibers with hypomyelination and variable internodal myelination. Muscle biopsy revealed classical features of inclusion-body-myopathy. Upon genetic diagnostic work-up the MPZ-mutation c.320A&gt;T, p.Glu107Val was detected.

Study Design: An observational, prospective, uncontrolled, open-label multi-centric study. Place and Duration of Study: Patients were recruited from 12 cities across India by 61 investigators, between October 2010 and December 2011. Methodology: We included 1500 patients (973 men, 527 women; age range 15-85 years) with Acid Peptic disorder. Lafutidine (10 mg tablets) was prescribed by the physicians as once daily dose (OD) for 28 days. The efficacy was analysed based on the change in the symptom baseline score on the 100 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for individual symptoms, and the safety was determined based on adverse events reported during the study with the prescribed usage of lafutidine on day 14 and day 28 after start of the treatment. Results: Lafutidine monotherapy was given to 1378 patients. A very high reduction in the mean VAS score was observed from baseline for individual symptoms, viz. nausea, vomiting, belching, heart burn, epigastric pain, acid regurgitation, abdominal bloating &amp; loss of appetite at the end of the study. The global mean VAS score (a sum of individual symptom VAS score) of these patients decreased from 120.34 ± 67.58 to 14.18 ± 26.97 at the end of the study (P &lt; .001). There were 124 APD patients, previously treated but uncontrolled, with acid inhibitors like PPIs, H2RAs etc., also showed a significant reduction (157.42 ± 83.88 to 26.47 ± 46.34) in the VAS score on day 28 (P&lt;.001).

The prefrontal lobe functions include ambition, cognition, emotions, information evaluation, mental integration, voluntary activity, and organized response. Violent behavior is related to aggression, with less serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid interaction, more dopamine, and more testosterone. Violent behavior is reinforced by negative experiences including viewing of violence in childhood and successful problem solving by violence. Every person has a natural and intrinsic need to establish the meaning of life, relative to ambition. Purpose in life (PIL)/ikigai means an attitude to establish the meaning of life. The term PIL/ikigai has been commonly used in daily life for many years in Japan. PIL/ikigai contributes to a greater ability to cope with stress, i.e., greater pleasure and comfort as well as less anxiety and confusion during stressful situations. This process leads to increasing serotonin and decreasing testosterone. PIL/ikigai is reinforced by positive experiences, including being moved by persons and events, success in challenging events, spending time in beautiful natural surroundings, and warm-hearted human relations. Moderate aerobic exercise, e.g., walking and running, causes pleasure. This process results in improvement of the autonomic nervous system, i.e., optimal balance between the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system, and optimally balanced secretions of dopamine, -endorphin, and serotonin. PIL/ikigai, performing aerobic exercise and violent behavior are prefrontal lobe functions. Prefrontal lobe function develops even during adulthood as the result of experiences.

Attention must therefore be given in the first place to the modifications induced in red blood cells (RBC) by the parasite in order to survive and display its pathogenic action: in this context, both the production of novel transport pathways able to support the development of the parasite during the erythrocytic cycle (in a cell which has lost transport activities during maturation process) and the changes induced to the RBC actin cyto-skeleton are discussed. As for the mechanisms involved in protection from P. falciparum infection, they can be of genetic, molecular, immunological character as well as interactive, due to the interplay of different factors. Some protection is afforded by genetic changes preventing P. falciparum to survive and proliferate within the red cell: such changes may include variants of the “basigin” receptor for the parasite antigens and inhibition by HbS of parasite-induced red cell remodelling. P. vivax infection may also be reduced in Duffynegative heterozygotes. Genetic factors specifically interacting with the development of the infection are the sickle cell trait, the presence of foetal Haemoglobin (HbF), particularly in its pancellular distribution and genes associated with malaria resistance, identified by genome-wide linkage studies. Selective advantage of HbAS heterozygotes over HbS homozygotes in the clinical course of malaria can be explained by the so called “balanced polymorphism”. The presence of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) has also a protective effect, due to retardation of parasite growth in such situation: this is the rationale behind the attempts to reactivate HbF production in Sickle Cell Disease(SCD). Phagocytosis of infected red blood cells (RBC’s) has a significant protective effect by keeping a low level of parasitemia in HbAS subjects. Recent research also points to the role of modifications of RBC’s adherence to microvascular endothelium as an important factor in the pathogenesis of malaria and suggest that abnormal Hb’s like HbS and HbC as well as α-thalassemia can impair the adhesion of the parasite major ligand to host cells, thus limiting the sequestration of parasite –invaded red cells in many tissues and organs, like the brain. A special role in protection from malaria can be ascribed to molecular mediators, particularly a sequence involving haeme-oxygenase (HMO-1), which appears upregulated in transgenic sickle cell mice: the action of HMO-1 prevents the cytotoxic effect of free heme and is in turn mediated by carbon monoxide, which inhibits Hb oxidation and further release of haeme from haemoglobin. Immunological factors are important, as shown by the development of children immunity to malaria, a rapid process in the early years of age (anti-disease immunity) and a slower one later (anti-parasite immunity); of remarkable interest are the antibodies to variant surface antigens (VSA) expressed by the parasite: an association was actually found between HbAS and the presence of IgG anti-VSA responses. Tolerance to parasite infection seems possible as the presence of β-chain mutations like in HbSAD mice provides a reduced incidence of experimental cerebral malaria. The possible role of various types of interferon is also under scrutiny. An example of interactions between different pathways comes from very recent studies, as it has been found that a mutation in the FAS gene promoter encoding the protein C- 95 results in a reduction of severe malaria incidence; as C-95 promotes apoptosis, an effect due to a C-95 – aided killing of immune cells, thus preventing an excessive immune response, is an interesting case of molecular-immunological interplay. Moreover, recent data on the mechanisms of malaria resistance, , show that during the intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum, two microRNA (miRNA),highly enriched in HbAS and HbSS erythrocytes, become integrated into the parasite messenger RNAs and cause translational inhibition, thus acting as negative regulators of parasite growth. It appears therefore that a very peculiar host defense strategy is working in sickle cell erythrocytes through miRNA activity."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T11:58:45Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"HbS;"},{"subject":"HbC;"},{"subject":"sickle cell trait;"},{"subject":"α-thalassemia;"},{"subject":"protection from malaria;"},{"subject":"red cell ligands;"},{"subject":"basigin receptor;"},{"subject":"haeme-oxygenase;"},{"subject":"immunity acquisition."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-11","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-11","titles":[{"title":"Hbs Protection From P.

Peritoneal fluid revealed a WBC count of 1,499/mm3. Two days earlier, she had undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. Broad spectrum antibiotics were started to treat possible peritonitis. Surgical exploration revealed no perforation but murky peritoneal fluid was noted and gram stain showed mixed flora (both gram negative and gram positive rods); however, blood and peritoneal fluid culture grew only Streptococcus pneumoniae. Discussion and Conclusion: An occult perforation, which may not be obvious to the naked eye or signs of contrast extravasation can occur after esophagogastroduodenoscopy with manipulations and can lead to peritonitis, especially in high-risk patients such as those with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mixed peritonitis attributable to suspected micro-perforation after esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

Study Design: Thirteen children were included (11 boys, 2 girls) with median age at intervention of 16 months (4-96 months) and all underwent BAP for native CoA. Patients were followed-up by transthoracic echocardiography assessment of left ventricular function, LVM, recoarctation, and other complications. Follow-up period ranged from 9– 36 months (mean±SD, 24.38±8.22 months). Results: The mean peak systolic gradient decreased to ≤20 mmHg in 11 patients (84.6%), mean peak systolic gradient decreased from 61.15±12.44 mmHg before to 18.85±13.72 mmHg and 15.38±6.27 mmHg immediately after angioplasty and at last follow-up, respectively (P=0.00). There was recurrence of mean pressure gradient in two patients; the first patient was 4 months old and had a successful balloon angioplasty six months later and surgery was performed in the second patient. Ventricular function improved in all patients, mean left ventricular mass index (LVMI) during diastole significantly decreased from 142.27±131.22 before angioplasty to 69.55±54.38 g/cm2 at last follow-up (P=0.038). None of the patients developed aneurysms or any other complications at last follow-up.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Medicine Al-Hussein University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt, between May 2010 and April 2011. Methodology: The present study investigated the relationship among diabetes mellitus, lipid profiles, SOD activity, ESR, and CRP in the blood of 40 patients with type 2 diabetes with and without retinopathy and 20 healthy control subjects. The mean age of the diabetic patients was similar to that of control. The mean duration of the disease was 3.53 ± 1.17 years (1–5 years) in patients with type 2 diabetes without retinopathy and 18.7 ± 3.1 with retinopathy. Also we studied Arg213Gly dimorphism of the EC-SOD gene in type 2 diabetic patients with and without retinopathy and control persons using the PCR technique. Results: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) level was significantly decreased in diabetics and more markedly decrease in those with retinopathy. Total cholesterol (CHOL), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) levels were significantly increased in diabetics and more markedly increased in those with retinopathy compared with the control level. Genotype distribution of the EC-SOD in diabetic patients with and without retinopathy differed from normal individuals, as the argentines-to-glycine amino acid substitution was higher in diabetic patients compared with the normal individuals. Conclusion: The present study revealed that hyperglycemia produced marked oxidation impact as evidenced by a significant increase in lipid profile, lipid per oxidation products, as well as a significant decrease in the total SOD activity. Moreover, it showed that the genotype distribution of the EC-SOD was differed as the arginine-to-glycine amino acid substitution was higher in diabetic patients with and without retinopathy compared with the control individuals. This report emphasizes the important role of superoxide dismutase and its genotype distribution in diabetic patients with and without retinopathy, and hence the need for antioxidant supplements to delay the severity of diabetic retinopathy."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:00:12Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Lipid per oxidation;"},{"subject":"superoxide dismutase;"},{"subject":"polymorphisms;"},{"subject":"diabetes;"},{"subject":"retinopathy."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-02","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-02","titles":[{"title":"Molecular And Biochemical Study Of Superoxide Dismutase Gene Polymorphisms In Egyptian Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus With And Without Retinopathy"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7954","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:00Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7954","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Objective: The aim of this study was to identify cutaneous pathologies in patients attending an adult outpatient (HIV/AIDS) clinic department in a rural/suburban centre in the south geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Additionally it also aims to determine if there are differences in the pattern of presentation as compared to patients seen in other parts of the country and the world. Methods/Design: This is a prospective observational study conducted in the adult antiretroviral (ART) clinic of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Irrua Edo StateNigeria over a 12 month period involving HIV positive patients. All patients with skin complaints are included in the study while other patients without skin complaints are generally excluded. Results: A total of 9460 patients were seen during this period in the clinic including old, new and repeat visits. Four hundred and ninety patients had various dermatologic complaints at various times giving a 5.18% prevalence of the cutaneous pathology. The mean age of the patients was 38±10 years with a male: female ratio of 1:1.4(140:350). For easy of analysis these lesions were grouped into infective and non-infective pathologies. Infective pathologies dominated the main manifestation (viral- 37.1%, fungal 24.3% and bacterial 2.9%) and non-infective mainly neoplasms 5.7%, drug reactions 11.4% and others 18.6% (comprising post inflammatory hypopigmentation and hyperpigmention, pruritic eruptions of HIV, and papularurticaria (insect bite reactions).

Aims: To estimate the prevalence of H. pylori among patients suffering from upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, know the main risk factors leading to infection, and detect the clinical, endoscopic and pathological changes of the gastric mucosa of patients infected with H. pylori. Place and Duration of Study: This is a five-months prospective study conducted in King Fahd Hospital, Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Methodology: H. pylori status in patients was determined by two biopsy based tests (histology and rapid urease test) as invasive tests and by a serological testing (ELISA IgG) as non-invasive test. Results: The age of the selected 68 patients ranged from 18-70 years with a mean age of 37.9 ± 14.15 years. H. pylori was more prevalent among males than females (70.5% vs 29.5%, p=0.020) and among age group (18-&lt; 30) years. No significant difference was estimated between positive and negative HP cases in residency, work status, marital status, smoking, socioeconomic level and aspirin intake. The most common complaints in the selected patients having endoscopy were: epigastric pain, heart burn, and dyspepsia. A significant correlation was detected between H. pylori and each of age, sex and Diabetes Mellitus. The most prevalent endoscopic findings of the positive H. pylori cases were mild gastritis (84.1%). There was a significant difference in gastritis (p=0.003) and duodenitis (p=0.031) between positive and negative cases for H. pylori histopathology. The prevalence of H. pylori was 60.29% by rapid urease test, 64.7% by histopathological examination and 67.6% by serology among the studied cases.

Only about 22% of all the respondents have applied the policy. The study also reveals that the level of knowledge of disinfection policy is not significantly related to the level of its application by the healthcare workers in the southeast (P-value 0.143, for chi-square and 0.49, for Pearson Correlation). Up to 78% of the healthcare workers have an idea about the different levels of disinfection. The University Teaching Hospitals seem to have better knowledge and use of the policy than the Federal Medical Centres and the General Hospitals.

Methodology: Age between 18 to 22 years was selected and divided into three groups. Group I: control group consists (n=81) with no family history of diabetes. Group II: (n=147) with one of their parents with history of type 2 diabetes. Group III: (n=47) with both parents having history of type 2 diabetes. In all the groups we estimated fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, insulin and adiponectin and osteocalcin. Results: We observed significant lower levels of adiponectin 8.7 ± 1μg/ml in group-III and 9.5 ±1.3 μg/ml in group-II when compared to control 11.0 ± 1.2 μg/ml (p&lt;0.01) and HOMA-IR in children of diabetic parents had a statistically significant correlation with plasma Adiponectin with Pearson’s coefficient -0.504. Through linear regression analysis parental diabetes influences plasma adiponectin p &lt;0.01 (B -1.50, 95% CI -1.79 - -1.20) but not osteocalcin P&gt;0.05 (B .313, 95% CI -.114 - .740) levels in children of diabetic parents.

NS is descriptively classified upon the patients’ response to steroid treatment as steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) or steroidresistant NS (SRNS). Aim: describe and compare different management strategies for SRNS. Methods: This retrospective study included 53 SRNS who were attending the Nephrology Outpatient Clinic, Children's Hospital, and Cairo University for follow-up. Results: out of 53 SRNS patients, 29 (54.72%) patients showed complete response to immunosuppressive therapy, while 14 (25.42%) showed partial response and the remaining 10 (18.87%) showed no response. Conclusion: Partial response to steroids or to first line of immunosuppressive therapy predicts better response to further immunosuppressives in SRNS patient. Cyclophosphamide is a preferable line in MCNS as it gives good results (50% complete response) with the advantage of lower cost and shorter duration of use.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: University of Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria between January - April 2010. Methodology: A total of 407 right hand dominant students (210 males and 197 females) aged 18 – 35 years who were purely of Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba origin by both parents and grandparents, are included in this study. Each person has been studied for measurements of stature, hand length and handbreadth. Results: No significant difference was observed in stature and hand dimensions between the Igbos and Hausas. However the Yorubas are significantly shorter and have shorter hands than the Igbos and the Hausas. The males are significantly taller than the females in all the three tribes and have longer hands than the females in the Hausas and Igbos. Both the sexes of Yorubas are significantly shorter than the Hausas and have significantly shorter hands than the Hausas and Igbos when comparison was made between same sexes. The Yoruba females have shorter but wider hands than the Hausa females. No significant difference was observed in stature and hand dimensions between the Hausas and Igbos when compared between same sexes. Regression equations for estimation of stature were formulated for each ethnic group and both sexes. Conclusion: The study supports the fact that variations are present not only between races but also among ethnic groups, thus formulae derived for one ethnic group and both sexes may not be applicable to other ethnic group and sex.

Current evidence indicates that countries including America and West Africa have more cases of aggressive progressive prostate cancer. Many treatment strategies have been used in management of prostate cancer. Since the discovery of androgen deprivation protocol seventy years ago, more treatment strategies have been reported which added more values to treatment outcome. However, death from this disease is due to resistance to androgen ablation therapy (AAT). Until recently, treatment of patients with disseminated prostate cancer was based on modalities that reduce AR signalling, either by direct androgen depletion (castration, e.g., surgical orchiectomy, luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists), by blockage of the androgen receptor (AR) (e.g., flutamide, bicalutamide), or by combinations. In literature there is wide range of reports on diverse treatment strategies for prostate cancer; this often lead to serious confusion among clinicians and scientists, especially those new to the field. This study reviewed all the current available treatment strategies for androgen ablation therapy in management of hormone sensitive progressive prostate cancer, and highlights the merits and challenges involved in each of the treatments options.

We focus on LMICs, many of which are at an early stage of implementation of these evidence-based policy processes. This review aimed at analyzing the ethical and procedural principles that underlie these social values, their potential conflict and the challenges of implementing a decision-making process according to these values in LMIC. Methods: Broad scoping search of international literature (December 2012) in PubMed, Cinahl, ISI Web of knowledge, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. Search terms were “social values”, “healthcare/ health” and “low and middle income countries” (terms adapted according to each database). There was no pre-defined limit of year or language. We excluded “grey literature” documents only. From a total of 252 hits, we finally selected and fully read 51 of them. Results: The translation of health policy decisions from high-income countries to LMICs is complex, as they have differences that might affect the expected outcomes. Decisions should primarily aim at improving population health. The measurement of socioeconomic status and social inequalities in health, which is also context-specific, it is another primary objective in decisions about healthcare policies. Autonomy and equity might conflict in scenarios of limited budget. However, individual autonomy should be limited when affects other´s individuals autonomy and social welfare. Evidence and transparency in the decision process is highly valued, and expenditure in information for decision-making should be promoted since it increases population health. Conclusion: High-quality research evidence is paramount to implement health policies consistent with social values and the resources needed to produce relevant evidence can be considered a good use of public resources. A framework for decision-making should be anchored at least in three first order social values, improvement of population health, improving equity (in access to healthcare and health) and transparency."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:05:33Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Social values;"},{"subject":"research evidence;"},{"subject":"equity in health;"},{"subject":"health policy;"},{"subject":"public health;"},{"subject":"low and middle-income countries (LMICs);"},{"subject":"developing countries."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-04","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-04","titles":[{"title":"Examining The Link Between Equity-Centered Health Policies, Autonomy And Decision- Making Process In Low And Middle Income Countries"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7972","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:02Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7972","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

We provide images and stress the importance of differential diagnosis based on imaging. Presentation of the Case: We report a case of a 26 years old nulliparous, with a leiomyoma developed on the posterior upper third of the vagina surgically removed. The patient came to our Unit with dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia and underwent physical examination and ultrasound scan. Both exams were executed per transrectal way because of her being a virgo. A Computed Tomography scan has been executed too. All the results pointed out the presence of a round-shaped, well delimitated, solid mass in posterior vaginal wall. Magnetic Resonance confirmed this diagnosis. Discussion: We widely discuss the symptomathologic cortege, the diagnostic iter based on imaging we settled down, the possible differential diagnosis, and surgical therapy performed. Concordance of imaging, negativity of tumor markers and general well-being status of the patient led to the diagnostical hypotesis of vaginal benign neoformation. These data excluded other diagnosis as endometriosis, uterine fibroma, primitive vaginal malignant tumor and metastasis of other-site primitive malignant neoplasia. The patient has been treated by surgical transvaginal excission therapy. Conclusion: US imaging and MR gives us the possibility to recognize a mass and to discern his nature and localization, thus to choose the best therapy in each case. Hystopathology still represent the gold standard in making a diagnosis in gynaecological oncology."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:06:08Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Leiomyoma;"},{"subject":"vaginal tumors;"},{"subject":"RM imaging;"},{"subject":"US;"},{"subject":"rare neoplasias."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-03","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-03","titles":[{"title":"Us And Mr Findings In Primary Vaginal Leiomyoma: A Case Report"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7974","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:02Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7974","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Interdisciplinary dental collaborations seem to be based on different conceptions with the consequence of various strengths but also weaknesses within teams. Study Design: International questionnaire (Germane, English, Russian). Place and Duration of Study: 250 questionnaires were handed out in paper form and 100 access codes for the Web-based version were sent. The survey was conducted between February and May 2011. Methodology: Dentists as well as dental technicians were permitted to participate in the survey. Candidates were recruited at postgraduate educational events. Previous participants of similar educational events were sent an access code via e-mail. Results: 132 questionnaires were evaluated (response rate of 37.7%). Of the surveyed persons, 60 were women (47%) and 72 were men (53%). The mean age of the respondents was 40.3 years +/-11.51 years. Associations with other specialties (n=84, 63.6%), solutions for unresolved problems (n=83, 62.9%), and expansion of one's own specialty (n=65, 49.2%) were the most frequently cited reasons to favor the use of interdisciplinary task groups. Difficult or ambiguous communication (n=73, 55.3%), conflicts within the team (n=70, 53.0%), and scheduling difficulties (n=63, 47.7%) were the most frequently cited reasons for not pursuing interdisciplinary cooperation, followed by rising costs and the expense of resources (n=62, 47.0%), the need to modify one's own concept (n=58, 43.2%), and the absence of a balance between workload and financial remuneration (n=52, 38.6%). Conclusion: Interdisciplinarity should not be regarded as the opposite of technological specialization. On the contrary, advancing technological developments in IDD will probably enforce a certain degree of specialization. Therefore, in the future it will become necessary not to lose contact with other specialties, keep open communication lines by means of a common language and common concepts, and also maintain communication with other medical specialties."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:06:28Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Interdisciplinarity;"},{"subject":"interdisciplinary dentistry;"},{"subject":"teamwork;"},{"subject":"dental education."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-03","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-03","titles":[{"title":"Concepts, Aims And Drawbacks In Interdisciplinary Dentistry: Results Of An International Questionnaire"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7975","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:02Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7975","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The incidence of clavicular fracture varies and the methods of treatment which is determine by the classification, age, fracture characteristics and the patients preference also varies although clavicular fractures are traditionally treated non-operatively. In the northern part of Ghana fractures are very common yet there has not been any study on the incidence of clavicular fractures and the preferred mode of treatment. Aim: The aim of the present study is to retrospectively investigate the incidence of clavicular fracture and the preferred mode of management among fracture patients over a five year period. Study Design: Retrospective Place and Duration of Study: Tania specialist Orthopaedic Hospital, Tamale, Ghana. Methodology: Data regarding patient's age and sex, laterality involved, cause of injury and the mode of management of the fracture from January, 2007 to December, 2012 were analysed. Results: The incidence of clavicular fracture over the study period was 12.8% of all fractured cases. Majority of the subjects (71.4%) with clavicular fractures were aged 21 to 40 years. Old cases constituted 58.9% whiles only 41.1% of the cases were fresh fractures. About 70% of the old cases were people who had received management from traditional bonesetters. The fracture occurred on the clavicle of the right arm in 60.7% of the patients. Middle third fractures accounted for 78.6% with only 21.4% occurring on the distal third of the clavicle. The major cause of clavicular fractures in this study was road traffic accident constituting 83.0% followed by a fall from heights 11.6%. Conclusion: The incidence of clavicular fracture among the study subject was relatively high. Road traffic accidents were the most common cause of the injury and the preferred mode of management is the operative management using open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:06:45Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Clavicle;"},{"subject":"bonesetters;"},{"subject":"fracture;"},{"subject":"Northern Ghana."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-03","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-03","titles":[{"title":"Incidence Of Clavicular Fractures And Its Management In Northern Ghana"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7976","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:03Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7976","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

We want to address the difficult question if observational evidence under some circumstances can validate intervention effects. Methodology: Assessment of previous argumentation aiming at a clear conclusion for future decision-making. Results: We present five arguments demonstrating the fundamental need of randomized clinical trials to sufficiently validate intervention effects. Furthermore, we argue that hindrances to the conduct of randomized clinical trials can be lessened through education, collaboration, infrastructure, and other measures. Our arguments validate why the randomized clinical trial should and must be the study design evaluating interventions. By choosing the randomized clinical trial as the primary study design, effective preventive, prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions will reach more patients earlier. Conclusion: Clinical experience or observational studies should never be used as the sole basis for assessment of intervention effects — randomized clinical trials are always needed. Therefore, always randomize the first patient as Thomas C Chalmers suggested in 1977.

Study Design: In vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pharmacy, School of Science &amp; Engineering, Southeast University, Banani, Dhaka between June 2011 and March 2012. Methodology: In vitro antioxidant activity was performed using DPPH radical scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) scavenging, reducing power, total antioxidant capacity, total phenol and total flavonoid content determination assays. The antimicrobial assay was performed by disc diffusion method using kanamycin and Nystatin as the standard. Results: The most prominent antioxidant activity was observed with PLPE in DPPH radical scavenging test (IC50 =191.308 ± 28.450 μg/ml) as opposed to that of standard ascorbic acid (IC50= 43.129 ± 1.181μg/ml). In total antioxidant capacity method, FHCE showed the highest activity (837.558 ± 110.835 mg ascorbic acid/g). The total phenolic and flavonoids content were determined by Folin–Ciocalteu Reagent and aluminum chloride colorimetric method respectively. The highest total phenols &amp; total flavonoids content were found in VNPE (180.434 ± 142.19 mg Gallic acid/g &amp; 1265.255 ± 165.593 mg quercetin/g, respectively). The ferric reducing capacity of the extracts was strong and dose dependent manner. PLPE displayed the highest antimicrobial actions against Bacillus megaterium (40 mm).

A 58-year-old Caucasian female has been receiving chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for four years secondary to polycystic kidney disease. Laboratory studies revealed: albumin-corrected calcium 9.0 mg/dL, phosphorus 5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 58 U/L [normal, 40-105], albumin 3.4 gm/dL [normal, 3.6-5.4] and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) 315 pg/mL [normal, 40-72]. Marked osteoporosis was noted on the DXA scan, preventing her from renal transplantation considerations. She had failed conventional medical treatment, including per os calcium, monthly ergocalciferol (50,000 units/month), activated vitamin-D analog (doxercalciferol) and renal-failure adjusted alendronate (70 mg twice a month). She was started on subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg every 6 months. After her first dose, she developed a progressive drop of calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate and magnesium, in spite of massive escalation of doxercalciferol and calcium supplementation. Hypocalcemia nadired at 6.3 mg/dL with symptomatic tetany, requiring a brief hospitalization approximately 7 weeks after denosumab treatment. Her elevated PTH rose further transiently (647 pg/mL), along with ALP (123 U/L). Bone-mineral parameters normalized approximately 3 months after denosumab administration. The observed phenomenon resembled the phenotype of “hungry bone syndrome” observed after surgical parathyroidectomy. Conclusion: Treatment decisions based on bone densitometry results alone are not transposable between patients with or without end-stage renal disease. Denosumab may lead to critical hypocalcemia in dialysis patients and further aggravate existing secondary hyperparathyroidism."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:08:19Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Denosumab;"},{"subject":"end-stage renal disease;"},{"subject":"hungry bone syndrome;"},{"subject":"hypocalcemia;"},{"subject":"osteoporosis;"},{"subject":"RANK ligand inhibitor;"},{"subject":"tetany."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-23","titles":[{"title":"Severe Symptomatic Hypocalcemia After Denosumab Administration In An End-Stage Renal Disease Patient On Peritoneal Dialysis With Controlled Secondary Hyperparathyroidism"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7981","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:03Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7981","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Retrospective study of patients presenting with PROM at and beyond 34 weeks gestation over a 3 year period. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Nigeria, between July 2007 and June 2010. Methodology: Case files of 92 patients with PROM and live, singleton fetuses, at and beyond 34 weeks gestation, in the study period, were retrieved from the hospital Health Records Department, collated and analyzed. Data collected included parity, estimated gestational age (EGA) at PROM, latency period (time interval from PROM to onset of labour), intervention following PROM, eventual mode of delivery and neonatal outcome. Results: A total of 2340 deliveries were recorded in the study period and 92 cases of PROM were on record for the period. However, only 74 PROM cases were included in the study, due to incomplete information. Incidence of PROM was therefore 3.9%. Length of latency period had a direct influence on the number of patients that went into spontaneous labour (P = 0.012) and subsequent vaginal delivery (P = 0.021). Induction of labour did not increase rate of caesarean section (P = 0.449) and had no effect on neonatal outcome (P = 0.239). Conclusion: Acceptable approach for the management of PROM at and beyond 34 weeks would be expectant management for the 1st 24 hours and induction of labor afterwards in patients who have not progressed into spontaneous labour. Expectant management in the extended latency period in the late preterm PROM group is associated with increased NICU admission (OR 7.33, 95% C.I 2.45 – 21.98); however, this did not affect duration of NICU stay or neonatal mortality."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:08:34Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Term PROM;"},{"subject":"Late preterm PROM;"},{"subject":"latency period."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-23","titles":[{"title":"Interventions And Neonatal Outcomes In Patients With Premature Rupture Of Fetal Membranes At And Beyond 34 Weeks Gestational Age At A Tertiary Health Facility In Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7982","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:03Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7982","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Retrospective case series. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, New Jersey Medical School between January 2001 and June 2010. Methodology: The medical records of all patients presenting with OG injuries to University Hospital, Newark, NJ from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2010 were reviewed. Demographics, characteristics of the trauma, ophthalmic findings, and outcomes were compared in male and female patients. Results: A total 603 eyes (602 patients) with OG injuries were identified. Most of the patients (76.4%) were male. The mean patient age was 39.14 years which was significantly lower in males (35.66 years vs. 50.43 years in females; p&lt;0.001). The vast majority of injuries were penetrating and/or work-related in men, whereas fall-related ruptures comprised the most common pattern of injury in women. Zone I was the most commonly injured zone in both genders, and Zone III wounds were more commonly seen in males (p=0.03). Although females were more likely to present with a worse visual acuity (VA, p=0.005), the final VA was not significantly different between males and females (p=0.06), and a statistically significant improvement in vision occurred in both genders (p&lt;0.001 in both). Fifteen percent of patients had an unfavorable anatomic outcome and underwent either primary or secondary enucleation; the rate was not different among males and females (17% in both).

Ara-C is widely prescribed antineoplastic drug, especially for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. It is a pyrimidine analog, in which the ribose sugar of cytidine is replaced by arabinose moiety. Methodology: Positive control group of mice was only given intraperitoneal dose of ara- C of 75 mg/kg (every 12 h for 5 days); this dose was selected in accordance with its human therapeutic values. Negative control group of mice group only received 0.1 ml sterile distilled water every 12 hours for 5 days. Three treatment groups of mice were given same dose of ara-C in addition to three different doses of DHA (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg of mice). Experimental data were analyzed using (Mann–Whitney U-test) to compare values of positive and negative controls. However, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test were used to compare values of treatments with positive control. All values were accepted at p = 0.05. Results: When 75 mg/kg ara-C was applied, positive control group showed a significant increase in MN and CA, a high decrease in PCE, and a significant decrease in MI. When DHA was used with ara-C, the picture is changed, particularly at a medium dose of DHA of 250 mg/kg where a decrease MN and CA and an increase in PCEs in addition to an increase in MI were observed. Conclusion: DHA at 250 mg/kg was able to reduce cytogenotoxicity of ara-C, and lead to protecting the normal proliferating cells in bone marrow from the damaging effect of ara-C and hence improving therapy by ara-C."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:09:09Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Ara-C;"},{"subject":"DHA;"},{"subject":"bone marrow;"},{"subject":"chromosomal aberration;"},{"subject":"micronucleus;"},{"subject":"MI;"},{"subject":"PCEs;"},{"subject":"cyto-genotoxicity."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-23","titles":[{"title":"Docosahexaenoic Acid Reduces Cyto- Genotoxicity Of Cytosine Arabinoside In Normal Mouse Bone Marrow"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7984","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:04Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7984","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The study is aimed at providing the determinants of in-hospital mortality of patients admitted in the gastroenterology and medicine unit (GMU) of the teaching hospital of Yopougon (Abidjan, Ivory Coast). Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort of 341 patients (males: 53%, mean age: 43 years) admitted in the GMU during 2009 were studied. Socio-demographic, clinical, biological characteristics of patients were retrieved. Survival probability and determinants of in-hospital mortality were respectively determined by the Kaplan Meier curve and Cox model. Results: Among the 341 patients admitted, 79 (23.2%) died in the GMU. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.3 (95%IC: 3.3-5.2) death per 100 patients-day. The main diagnoses were HIV/AIDS (15%), cirrhosis (14.4%), hepatocellular carcinoma (13.5%), tuberculosis (12.6%) and gastroenteritis (7.9%).

This study seeks to test the effect of health education on perception and treatment seeking behaviour among care givers of under fives in a rural setting in Ogun State, Nigeria. The study design was a quasi-experimental study carried out in Ijebu North Local Government Area of Ogun State. A multistage random sampling technique was used in choosing the required samples for this study and a semi- structured questionnaire was used to collect relevant information. The intervention consisted of a structured educational programme based on a course content adapted from the national malaria control programme. A total of 400 respondents were recruited into the study with 200 each in both the experimental and control groups and were followed up for a period of 3 months when the knowledge and treatment seeking behaviour was reassessed. There was no statistically significant differences observed between the experimental and control groups in terms of socio-dermographic characteristics such as age [p=0.99], marital status [p=0.48], religion [p=0.1], and income [p=0.51]. The highest proportion of mothers reported malaria [45% &amp; 47%] in experimental and control groups respectively, followed by Upper respiratory tract infection [22% &amp; 25%], diarrhoea and vomiting [14% &amp; 17%], measles [12% &amp; 15%], convulsion [8% &amp; 11%] and others [3% &amp; 5%]. Only 52.1% (experimental) and 48% (control) groups of mothers believed that fever can kill a child. Furthermore, about 40% (experimental) and 44% (control) groups believed fever was not fatal while 8.0% of both groups were not sure. Post intervention, these differences were not statistically significant. The proportion of those who got their source of information about prevention of fever from health worker increased from 60.0% (preintervention) to 95.0% (post-intervention) (p&lt;0.001) compared to the control group which increased from 62.0% (pre-intervention) to 62.5% (post-intervention) (p&gt;0.001). Furthermore, 72.9% &amp; 50.8% of respondents in the experimental and control group respectively commenced treatment at the right time (first day of fever). There was a significant increase of 24.6% [p=0.001] post intervention in the experimental group with no significant change in the control [p=0.64]. The study concludes that a systematic health education programme to caregivers should be a component of Roll back Malaria programme in Africa. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential to control of infection and this can only be effectively carried out by those at the frontline of care at home."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:10:01Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Health education intervention;"},{"subject":"Perception;"},{"subject":"treatment seeking behaviour;"},{"subject":"Childhood infection;"},{"subject":"Nigeria."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-23","titles":[{"title":"The Impact Of Health Education Intervention On Perception And Treatment Seeking Behaviour About Childhood Infections Among Caregivers In Rural Communities In Western Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7987","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:04Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7987","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Presentation of Case: An 85-year-old man was examined for complete detachment and loss of the nail plates of the index and middle fingers of his right hand. There were no previous nail disorders or a recent traumatic injury. He was non-smoker and was not receiving any drug therapy before nail loss. Clinical symptoms and signs persisted after 10 days empirical use of antibiotics and local treatment. Culture samples by that time indicated an Enterobacter cloacae local infection. He was treated with topical application of the gentamycin injection solution on the nail beds. There was normal regrowth of the nails. No abnormality of the nail unit of both fingers was evident 2 years later. Discussion: The pathogenesis of nail shedding in our patient was assessed. Although a causal relation of nail loss and a primary Enterobacter cloacae infection was highly suggestive, other causes such as missed minor trauma, ischemia or idiopathic could not be excluded. Conclusion: A primary Enterobacter cloacae infection was the most likely cause of an acute nail shedding of the index and middle fingers of the right hand in an 85-year-old man.

Results: All 19 patients were able to complete the concomitant therapy, with just one patient not receiving all 7 cycles of weekly chemotherapy (missing one). Sixteen of 19 completed all four cycles, 2 completed 3 cycles and 1 completed 1 cycle of full dose docetaxel. During combined treatment, there were 3 transient grade 3 toxicities (diarrhea, hemoglobin decline, and hyperglycemia). There was no grade 4 toxicity. During full dose docetaxel, 3 patients suffered a grade 3 decline in WBC count and 2 went on to grade 4. Other single incidents of grade 3 toxicity were anxiety, fatigue, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, port infection and abscess. All the toxicities were transient. By the end of treatment, 89% had a decline in PSA. Conclusion: This is the first report of combined docetaxel and radiation in the post prostatectomy setting.

The PROBIT regression analysis was performed to determine the in vitro LC50. In vivo survival distributions were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and Cutler-Ederer analysis, and survival curves comparisons and hypothesis testing was done using the log-rank method. Results: Metal silver induced up to 100% L5178Y-R cells cytotoxicity, with an LC50 of 1.8 X 10-8 M, whereas silver nanoparticles caused up to 78% cytotoxicity, with an LC50 of 14.4 X 10-8 M. In addition, Intramuscular administration of metal silver and silver nanoparticles administered at the time of tumor injection significantly (P = .05) increased mice survival, where 70% and 60% of mice survived at day 35 respectively, as compared with such treatments administered 7 days after tumor induction (55% and 25% survival respectively); vincristine treatment caused 50% mice survival and tumor-bearing control mice had 20% survival.

Case Presentation: A 61-year-old man working in a fur industry was treated for three distinct episodes of a felon of the right thumb within an 8-month period. He was treated successfully with surgical drainage and antibiotics following each episode. He was symptom-free and returned to work about two months following each episode. Felon formation, in all cases, was due to a Streptococcus constellatus infection secondary to mink hair penetration through the distal nail groove of his thumb. Using protective gloves, no further relapses have occurred during a 5-year follow-up. Discussion: A felon is an abscess of the pulp of a finger or thumb usually due to percutaneous trauma. Streptococcus constellatus, which is included in the Streptococcus milleri group, is often associated with various pyogenic infections. In the reported case, the lack of hand protection during fur processing was the cause of mink hair infiltration into the pulp of the patient’s thumb through the distal nail groove and of the three episodes of felon formation due to the secondary infection by Streptococcus constellatus.

Methods: Subjects were 543 consecutive recipients (August 2004-August 2007) of allogeneic HCT followed for overall survival for up to 6 years after HCT. Comparisons between patient groups with brain imaging and without brain imaging were tested using the Pearson chi-square test. Survival analyses with outcome time-to-brain-scan started at date of transplant and used Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: Of 543 HCT recipients, 128 patients (24%) underwent brain imaging during the first year after transplantation. There was a greater risk of brain imaging in unrelated donor transplants and in lymphoid as opposed to myeloid malignancies (respective hazard ratios 1.45 and 1.43, P=0.04). Overall survival was significantly worse in unrelated donor transplants (hazard ratio 1.42, P=0.003) and in cord blood transplants (hazard ratio 1.68, P=0.02). Landmark survival analysis of patients alive 1 year after HCT showed worse survival over the next 5 years in those who had brain imaging in the first post transplant year (P&lt;0.0001).

Relevant radiofrequency (RF) and/or microwave ablation techniques that have been in vogue and in traditional use across clinical procedures are revisited. Traditionally, RF/microwave ablations have been applied to a variety of pathological states, (in lieu of surgical methods and/or electrocautry procedures) so as to remove unwanted/cancerous tissue layers. Relevantly, new avenues of adopting unexplored electromagnetic (EM) energy falling in the spectral range of mm-wave/THz frequencies for such medical ablation purposes are studied. These higher frequencies for ablation can be considered either to supplant or used in parallel with the existing RF/microwave bands (at 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz). The motivation thereof is to identify certain improved ablation feasibility and derivable merits in clinical sense. Hence, the efficacy of the proposed scheme is identified for two exemplar ablation therapy procedures pertinent to Barrett’s esophagus and menorrhagia. Pertinent pros and cons are discussed and practical ablator designs are indicated. Study Details: Considering the strategy of using the proposed mm-wave/THz EM energy would amount to a shallow ablation via ‘thermal scouring’ of the tissue-linings intended for ablation and prevent otherwise undesirable hot-spots in deep-tissue media. This is conceivable because the advocated frequency bands would allow a very shallow skin-depth of penetration of EM energy; and hence, tissue-heating will be limited only to superficial linings. Further, the associated super-high frequency will heat the ablation site extremely fast reducing the procedure time considerably. In a Nut-shell: The study first offers a comprehensive review on classical and projects de novo aspects of EM ablation therapy with unexplored electromagnetic spectral resources of mm-Wave/THz band. Illustrated as examples are feasibility details concerning the ablation of the endometrium and Barrett’s esophagus. Design aspects of ablators are presented. Place and Duration of Study: The study reported is limited to a review on the subjectmatter and provides analytical designs and computational models on the procedure performed (2012-2013) at: Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, College of Engineering &amp; Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, USA."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:13:22Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"RF/microwave ablation;"},{"subject":"mm-wave/THz frequency ablation;"},{"subject":"Barrett’s esophagus;"},{"subject":"endometrial ablation."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-06-03","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-06-03","titles":[{"title":"De Novo Radio Frequency Ablation Therapy: Application Of Unexplored Electromagnetic Spectral Resources Of Mm-Wave/Thz Band In Clinical Ablation Procedures - A Review"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7998","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:05Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7998","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

It is composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal tissues resembling embryonic lung tissue. BPB is considered to be distinct from other lung tumors based on pathological features, clinical course and prognosis. Presentation of Case: The authors report an atypical case of BPB in a 27 -year-old man presented with complaints of dyspnea and left-sided chest pain for the previous four months. A chest radiograph showed the presence of an opaque left hemithorax, and the mediastinum was pushed toward the left. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a mixed solid and cystic process with variable contrast enhancement measuring 15,4 x 13,7 cm occupying the totality of the left hemithorax, pleural effusion, and a collapsed left lung, with contralateral mediastinal shift. A transthoracic needle pleural biopsy yielded a diagnosis of BPB.A general examination shows a peritoneal effusion. One month after diagnosis, the tumor grew rapidly, and therefore he was treated only by palliative care. He died from respiratory failure one month later. Although BPB is rare, this entity is increasingly described. Conclusion: The purpose of presenting this case report is to raise awareness among clinicians to consider this clinical entity as a differential diagnosis when a pleural mass is identified. Histological examination is the most reliable and conclusive method of diagnosing BPB and differentiating it from other primary or metastatic lung malignancies."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:13:39Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Biphasic;"},{"subject":"pulmonary;"},{"subject":"blastoma."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-24","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-24","titles":[{"title":"Biphasic Pulmonary Blastoma: A Case Report And Literature Review"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/7999","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:05Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7999","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Retrospective. Place and Duration of Study: Saint Louis University Hospital, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States, between May 2011 and May 2012. Methodology: Six NF1 pediatric patients underwent FDG PET/CT including the brain, for evaluation of extracranial neoplasm. Their brain PET images were compared with a pediatric comparison set (21 subjects) using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Significant differences between groups were examined at p&lt;0.001, uncorrected for voxel height and p&lt;0.05, corrected for cluster extent. Results: Compared with the comparison set, the 6 NF1 patients showed the largest cluster of reduced FDG uptake (3966 voxels) in the medial dorsal nucleus of bilateral thalami. Additional clusters of metabolism in the range from 415 to 926 voxels were noticed in the right cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area (BA) 8 and 24), left occipital lobe (BA 17 and 18) and right fronto-parietal lobe (BA 43). Conclusion: The FDG reduction of the bilateral thalami is compelling and may be most pathognomonic for NF1.

Methods: This nationwide survey, conducted in Kosovo in 2011, included 1753 individuals aged ≥65 years (886 men, 867 women; mean age 73.4±6.3 years; response rate: 77%). Participants were asked to assess, on a scale from 1 to 5, their level of difficulty with regard to access, understanding, appraisal, and application of health information. Subscale scores and an overall health literacy score were calculated for each participant. Information on socioeconomic characteristics was also collected. Results: Subscale scores of health literacy were strongly correlated with each-other (range of Spearman’s rho: 0.8-0.9). Mean values of the overall health literacy scores were significantly higher in men, urban residents, married individuals, the highly educated, and the better off participants.

Fifteen cases have been reported so far. Majority of these patients were female (male: female ratio 6:9) and their mean age was 54.5 years. Axillary lymph node metastases occurred concurrently or as recurrent disease after initial treatment of primary disease in about equal number of these patients. The predominant histological type was papillary carcinoma and 83.3% of these were poorly differentiated. Visceral metastases to lungs and bones were often seen. Despite treating these patients with thyroidectomy, lymph node clearance and adjuvant therapy, 40% of them died; some within one year and among the 60% who were alive, 30% still had active disease.

Study Design: Prevalence based cohort Place and Duration of Study: Penang General Hospital, Hospital USM, and– Univesiti Malaya Medical Center; 2005 – 2008. Methods: Study patients were placed in the TB only, DM only, or DM-TB groups,with each group including 200 patients. Information related to demographics, chronic disease comorbidity, duration of hypertension (HTN) and DM, and economic variables were obtained from the patients’ medical files both at the beginning and end of the study period. The economic burden of DM-TB patients was assessed from hospitalization periods, frequency of clinic visits, and diagnostic requests. Results: Durations of DM and HTN were 9.2 and 5.6 years, respectively, for the DMonly group compared to 5.3 and 1.1 years, respectively, for DM-TB subjects. For both diabetic groups, diabetes preceded HTN, with onset of HTN occurring approximately 4 years after patients were diagnosed diabetic. Approximately 86% of DM only subjects suffered additional comorbidity, and 44.5% had three or more coexisting chronic diseases compared to 56% and 11.4%, respectively, in the DM-TB group. The hospitalization period was 10.2 days for the DM-TB group compared to 7 and 4 days for the TB only and DM only groups, respectively; however, 43% of TB only subjects needed surgical intervention compared to 17% in the DM-TB group.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of in-hospital lethal or major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) (MACE) in patients with myocardial infarction, depending on the patients’ clinical data and the heliophysical environment during hospital admission and on the first subsequent days. Place and Duration of Study: The study included 1,579 patients who in 2005-2006 were treated in the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences and survived for more than one day. During hospitalization, 35 (2.2%) cases of death and 60 (3.8%) cases of MACE were registered. Methodology: The effect of geomagnetic storms, solar flares, and solar proton events was estimated by applying multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for clinical variables. Results: Geomagnetic storms occurring one day after hospital admission increased the risk of in-hospital death and MACE by over 2.9 times (respectively, OR=3.69, 95% CI 1.29-10.5; and OR=2.91, 95% CI 1.33-6.36). A dose-response relationship was observed between the daily geomagnetic level (quiet-unsettled, active, or stormy) on the day prior to hospitalization and the risk of mortality or MACE (respectively, 1; 1.98(0.75-5.19); 4.20(1.43-12.3), and 1; 2.41(1.19-4.91); 3.45(1.55-7.71)).

The study was designed to investigate the hepatoprotective potentials of Hibiscus polyphenolic rich extract (HPE), (a group of phenolic compounds occurring in the dried calyx of Hibiscus sabdariffa) against CCl4-induced damaged in rats. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Biochemistry, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomosho, Nigeria, between January 2011 and June 2012. Methodology: Liver injury was measured in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) along with reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH). The antioxidant activity of HPE was evaluated using DPPH and ABTH radical scavenging assay in vitro. Results: The antioxidant investigation showed that HPE was able to scavenge the ABTS and DPPH radicals and these radicals scavenging abilities were found to be dosedependent. Pretreatment of rats with different doses of HPE (50 and 100 mg/kg) significantly lowered serum ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and TBARS levels in CCl4 treated rats. GSH, SOD and CAT were significantly increased by pre-treatment with the HPE, in CCl4 treated rats. HPE was found to contain high level of total phenolic content (140.78mg/g in GAE/g dried weight). Hence, these data indicate that the dietary supplement of Hibiscus extract may inhibit liver damage in rats. Conclusion: The hepatoprotective activities observed in this study could be due to the ability of phenolic compounds to neutralize the free radicals produced from the metabolism of CCl4."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:17:12Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Hibiscus sabdariffa;"},{"subject":"antioxidants;"},{"subject":"lipid peroxidation;"},{"subject":"carbon tetrachloride;"},{"subject":"hepatoprotective."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-10","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-10","titles":[{"title":"Hepatoprotective And Antioxidant Effect Of Hibiscus Polyphenol Rich Extract (Hpe) Against Carbon Tetrachloride (Ccl4) - Induced Damage In Rats"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8011","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:07Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8011","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Results: The first dietary pattern characterized by low intake of fruits and yellow vegetables and high intake of refined grains and sugar-free beverages explained the largest proportion of variance in inflammation markers. After adjusting for confounding factors including energy intake, statin treatment, waist circumference, glycosylated hemoglobin and blood pressure, IL-6 (P&lt; 0.0001) and TNFα (P =0.0004) were positively associated with the first dietary pattern.

Semashko Municipal Hospital No 1 (Central Municipal Hospital) of Rostov-on-Don, Russia during the years of high (2000-2002) and low (2008-2010) solar activity. Methodology: The study involves 1135 patients who died of cerebral stroke. 5 observation groups were formed depending on the age: 1 group: 34 (3%) – less than 45 years old; 2 group: 200 (17.6%) - between 45-59 years old; 3 group: 540 (47.6%) - between 60-74 years old; 4 group: 356 (31.4%) - between 75-89 years old; 5 group: 5 (0.4%) - 90 and more years old. Nosological signs of disease and endogenous risk factors were recorded for each observation. To evaluate the complex impact of the environmental factors on the death rate of the vascular accidents, 44 exogenous risk factors were analyzed. Results: With the help of multivariate logistic regression method, after the construction of a mathematical model, nine endogenous and 8 exogenous factors, from amount participating in the analysis, which can be factors of immediate death risk for the patients belonging to various age groups, were detected. The coincidence of fact and calculations according to the gradations of the classification variable containing the meaning of number of age group, is ensured in 68.2% of cases (Concordant),coefficient of association Somers’D: .371. Model quality was evaluated according to the modeling sample. It is statistically proved, that death occurred with the patients of young and middle age because of diseases associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis of the 2-3 stage, alcohol. Characteristic CS type – hemorrhagic, especially hematoma class with blood breakthrough into the brain ventricles. Severe course of disease with frequent deaths in the 1st day are typical. In case of established combination of the pathogenic effect is mostly associated with high solar and geomagnetic activity. Among the patients of the elderly and the senile age appeared patients with secondary arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis of the 3-4 stage, heart diseases in the form of ciliary arrhythmia and coronary heart disease. Characteristic CS type – ischemic, especially non-atherothrombotic class. Death during the 1st day was statistically less likely. The maximum meteotropic reactions occur with contrasting weather patterns change, quick change of air masses with different thermal properties.

We provide images and stress the importance of differential diagnosis based on imaging, especially magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. Case Presentation: A 73-year-old woman developed a right hemiplegia suggestive of ischemic stroke. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) highlighted a diffuse tumor-related infiltration involving several lobes without contrast enhancement, corresponding to the specific description and definition of gliomatosis cerebri type 1. With the aid of MR spectroscopy, we correctly diagnosed the disease preoperatively, which was finally confirmed pathologically by stereotactic biopsy. During radiological follow-up, a contrast enhancement occurred on cerebral MRI, suggestive of progression to a gliomatosis cerebri type 2. Given a poor performance status, this elderly patient received palliative treatment. Discussion: Gliomatosis cerebri is a relatively rare but well-known entity, which affects mostly middle aged patients. It often presents with confounding clinical and imaging features, thus additional examinations such as MR spectroscopy are almost always necessary before reaching the correct diagnosis before biopsy. Conclusion: Contrast enhancement on cerebral MRI, which is usually absent, is found in case of transformation from type 1 gliomatosis cerebri to type 2. Some features on MR spectroscopy are helpful for gliomatosis cerebri diagnosis: N-acetylaspartate levels are diminished, levels of myoinositol are significantly elevated, but Cho/Cr ratio may be normal."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:18:12Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Gliomatosis cerebri;"},{"subject":"type 1;"},{"subject":"type 2;"},{"subject":"contrast enhancement;"},{"subject":"MR spectroscopy;"},{"subject":"myoinositol;"},{"subject":"stroke."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-06-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-06-28","titles":[{"title":"Gliomatosis Cerebri Type 1 Mimicking An Ischemic Stroke And Progressing To A Type 2: A Case Study And Literature Review"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8014","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:07Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8014","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: A prospective study developed in a cohort of women treated for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) lesion. Place and Duration of Study: Gynecology Oncology day clinic of Brazilian National Cancer Institute, between October 2004 and May 2006. Methodology: We included 285 women (age range 18-75 years) with CIN submitted to lesion excision. All patients were interviewed at admission to identify epidemiological and clinical characteristics, having blood samples collected, and a colposcopic examination performed. TP53 polymorphism was ascertained using PCR-RFLP. After treatment, the study population was followed up with Pap-tests during two years. Treatment failure was evaluated using histological confirmation of any altered tissue. Kaplan-Meyer curves and Cox Proportional Risk Model were used for data analysis. Results: Frequencies of TP53 polymorphisms were: Arg72Pro genotype(Arg/Pro)- 177(62.1%); Arg72 genotype(Arg/Arg)-55(19.3%); Pro genotype (Pro/Pro)-53(18.6%). Women with endocervical margins involvement showed an HR 7.01(1.73-28.44). Current smoking was statistically related to CIN treatment failure (HR:3.90,95%CI:1.28-11.91).

It is a waste of information to evaluate these data only for the efficacy and safety of the investigational medication. We propose extended evaluations of large trials for scientific purposes, especially to find the most important risk factors of the disease or variables which are associated with risk to have the disease. Methodology: The SPICE study is a controlled, randomised, completely masked trial that has investigated the efficacy of the Crataegus product WSÒ 1442 in 2681 randomised patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). It was initiated and sponsored by Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals. Results have already been published. We asked the sponsor to send us the data for an extended evaluation which was performed with a multivariate Cox regression model to find risk factors for the composite endpoint cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or hospitalisation due to progressive heart failure. Results: Most important risk factors are lower New York Heart Association (NYHA) function class, younger age and higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients had less cardiac events when taking glycosides, antiarrhythmics, nitrates, diuretics, beta blockers and calcium antagonists, so patients with a high number of cardiovascular medication have a poorer prognosis. Three scenarios for the interpretation of cardioactive medications as “risk” are presented. We assume that symptoms leading to the indication of a specific cardioactive medication are the risk. This risk is only partly balanced by medication intake. In general, the intake of cardioactive medication is associated with the risk to have the disease. Conclusion: An extended evaluation of large clinical studies finds out what is important for the outcome besides specific efficacy of the investigational drug. This is usually not the scope of pharmaceutical companies, but useful for science, doctors and patients."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:19:20Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Congestive heart failure;"},{"subject":"Prognostic factors;"},{"subject":"cox regression model;"},{"subject":"crataegus extract."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-06-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-06-28","titles":[{"title":"Prognostic Factors For Patients With Congestive Heart Failure - An Extended Evaluation Of The Spice-Study"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8018","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:07Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8018","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: BALB/c mice were transplanted with skin allografts from C57BL/6 mice and given either AS alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents. Average survival days of skin allografts were recorded and serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were quantified. BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 mice were challenged intraperitoneally with B16F10 melanoma cancer cells (cancer cell line syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice) and were then treated with AS. They were observed regularly for tumor growth. Results: The results indicated that in transplant mice AS given alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents prolonged allograft survival time through noncholesterol lowering mechanisms in spite of a non-significant change in serum cytokine levels. Furthermore, AS treatment enhanced tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice and promoted tumor growth in BALB/C mice.

There are only fewer reports of Seroprevalence in tertiary care centers. We aim to study the trends of such infections in a tertiary care teaching hospital located at South India. Study Design: This is a prospective study conducted over a 5 year period (2008-2012). Place and Duration of Study: Department of Microbiology, Prathima Institute of Medical Sciences, Karimnagar, Andhrapradesh, India from 2008-2012. Methodology: We performed a prospective study of patients presenting at the Prathima institute of medical Sciences, a rural tertiary care teaching hospital over a period of 5- years (Jan 2008 to Dec 2012). Screening for anti-HIV I and 2, HBsAg detection and anti- HCV antibodies test were carried out by commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Of the 16796 individuals tested a total of 570 (3.3%) showed seropositivity to one of the three viral infections tested. Among the population tested 258(1.5%) were seropositive for antibodies against HIV-1, and none showed HIV-2 seroprevalence (0%). Prevalence of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C were found as 305(1.8%) and 7(0.04%) respectively. Co-infection of HIV-1 with Hepatitis B was observed only in 10(0.06%) cases. Conclusion: The present study revealed that there was a slight increasing trend for Seroprevalence of HIV- 1 antibodies among the tested population. Hepatitis B surface antigen Seroprevalence has shown a gradual increase during the last five years.

Study Design: Cross sectional. Place and Duration of Study: From a total of 25 families of RTA followed up in Nephrology unit of Mansoura University Children's Hospital (MUCH), Egypt, two unrelated families were diagnosed as infantile nephropathic cystinosis using clinical suspicion plus mutation analysis of CTNS gene in the period between January 2008 and November 2012. Methodology: Two families with multiple cases of infantile nephropathic cystinosis have been diagnosed. In absence of high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry used for measuring intraleucocyte cystine, diagnostic tools for cystinosis used in the current work were clinical and laboratory evidences of PRTA, slit lamp detection of corneal cystine crystals and finally identification of CTNS gene mutations. All patients were subjected to routine echocardiography because of accidental discovery of heart malformation in one case. Rare mutant variant of the first family was subjected to RNA analysis which unfortunately failed, alternatively an in silico study was used to predict splice site. Results: All patients with cystinosis manifested a severe clinical course. Proband of family 1 showed two known mutations; deletion in the exon 3 (c.18_21 del GACT) and substitution in acceptor splice site of intron 11 (c.971 -12G&gt;A). In silico study predicted an anticipated splice site that modified the open reading frame in carboxy-terminal region. Probands of family 2 were affected by ventricular and atrial septal defects in younger, and mild mitral and aortic incompetence in older patient; their DNA analysis revealed a novel nonsense mutation (c.734 G&gt;A) which caused a premature stop codon in position 245 of protein. Conclusion: Nephropathic cystinosis has been diagnosed with ease in Egyptian population without need of sophisticated investigations.

Methodology: Sitagliptin 25-100 mg/day was added to the ongoing insulin therapy in those without any detectable post-meal C-peptide levels. HbA1c and other parameters were followed for 48 weeks. Results: Effective reductions of HbA1c levels were already observed at 12 weeks and sustainable throughout the study period. However, 2 subjects had severe hypoglycemic evens. Post-meal C-peptide remained undetectable with all the subjects. Interestingly, significant increases of body weight were observed. Conclusion: Sitagliptin as an adjunct to insulin in patients with absolute insulin deficiency may be effective and sustainable for at least 48 weeks, allowing for less intense therapy. However, it should be noted that some patients may have severe hypoglycemic events.

Place and Duration of the Study: Pediatric department, cardiology division, Cairo University Children’s Hospital, 5 years follow up. Methodology: We retrospectively reviewed the pre-completed data of 766 patients following up in the rheumatic fever clinic. Those with incomplete medical records were excluded. We compared between children younger than 5 years and those who are 5 years or older as regards their demographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory findings and echocardiographic findings. Results: We enrolled 667 patients; 17 of them (2.5%) were younger than 5 years (mean age 3.82± SD 0.393 years). The group of patients younger than 5 years old; included 10 females (58.8%) and 7 males (41.2%). Positive family history was encountered in 6 patients (37.7%). The most common presentations of the younger age group of patients were arthritis in 12 patients (70.5%), followed by carditis in 5 patients (29.4%), chorea in 3 patients (17.6%), and skin manifestations in 2 patients in the form of erythema marginatum (11.7%). Subclinical carditis was more common in younger children than the older group, with more severe valve affection. None of the patients in the younger age group had recurrence of the RF during a period of 5 years follow up while recurrences were encountered in 16 patients (2.5%) of the older age group. Conclusion: ARF can occur in children younger than 5 years.

Study Design: An observational, prospective, uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter post marketing study. Place and Duration of Study: Patients were enrolled from 62 centers across 11 states of India, between October 2010 and March 2012. Methodology: Out of 1500 APD patients, 1486 (850 men, 636 women; age range 16-85 years) were prescribed Troxipide 100mg tablet orally thrice daily. The efficacy and safety assessments were performed on day 14 and day 28 after beginning the treatment and recorded in the case report forms. The efficacy of Troxipide was estimated based on the changes from the baseline in the symptom score on a 100 point visual analogue scale (VAS) for individual symptoms. Safety was assessed by adverse events reported with usage of Troxipide on day 14 and day 28 after start of the treatment. Results: Troxipide monotherapy (n=1427) significantly reduced the mean VAS score from baseline for all major symptoms, viz. nausea, vomiting, belching, heart burn, epigastric pain, acid regurgitation, abdominal bloating &amp; loss of appetite at the end of the study. The global mean VAS score (a sum of individual symptom VAS score) of these patients decreased from 134.26 ± 75.31 to 21.88 ± 39.52 at the end of the study (P &lt; .001). All the patients who were previously treated but uncontrolled, with acid inhibitors like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) etc. had a significant reduction in the VAS score from 164.38 ± 64.54 to 35.56 ± 54.24 on day 28 (P&lt;.001). Troxipide was well tolerated with overall incidence of adverse events being 1.05% (n=15) and all the events were resolved without any sequel.

Dioscorea alata L. has been observed to possess flavonoids which induce antidiabetic effect and phenolic compounds which could help in weight management. It has been postulated that any therapeutic regimes that can limit weight gain while simultaneously controlling blood glucose levels will be effective in managing diabetes. This study was conducted to determine the effect of this rich plant on food intake, blood glucose and body weight in a normal non- diabetic state. Materials and Methods: The tuber was washed and the edible portion was dried at 50ºC, powdered, passed through 60 mesh sieve (BS), the powder was extracted with hot (70ºC) distilled water in a mechanical shaker for 24 h, filtered and freeze dried to yield aqueous extract. Twenty male wistar rats were used for this study; the rats were randomly assigned into five groups of five rats per group. Rats in group 1 served as control and were administered 0.3ml of 0.9% sodium chloride while Group 2, 3 and 4 received Dioscorea alata L. (DA) extract at 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 300mg/kg of body weight respectively for a period of 21 days. Food intake, Fasting blood glucose and body weight were measured. Results: The results showed that food intake, fasting blood glucose level and body weight were significantly (P=.05) reduced when compared with the control group.

Patients and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 70 Egyptian patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease and HCC patients. Patients were categorized into chronic HCV group (n=25), post-HCV cirrhosis group (n=24), HCC group (n=21) in addition to 7 healthy individuals who were candidates for living-donor related transplantation. Liver tissue obtained from all patients was subjected to total RNA extraction, reverse transcription of extracted RNA into cDNA and finally tissue expression of GPC-3, MDK, PEG-10, SERPINI1 and QP-C by qRT-PCR was assessed in each group. Results: A significant increase in hepatocyte expression of GPC-3, MDK, SERPINI1, and QP-C was detected in cancerous compared to non-cancerous liver tissue; in contrast, PEG-10 was significantly expressed in chronic HCV patients. The ROC curves was able to identify best cutoff values, sensitivity and specificity for GPC-3 (7.26, 81%, 58%), SERPINI1 (0.16, 80%, 70%), MDK (3.8, 60%, 70%) and QP-C (0.45, 65%, 79%) respectively.

An observational preliminary study” [1]. Somatostain has numerous physiological properties, including its inhibitor effect on bile secretion. This property has been used by Pitiakoudis and colleagues to treat patients with bile leak after hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgery. This interesting but preliminary study has showed promising results. However the data presented in this study cannot be used to definitely support the routine use of somatostatin in patients with bile leak after HPB surgery, because significant limitations and potential biases can be found in this study. This study consists of a very heterogeneous group of patients; furthermoew the number of patients included is very small (n=15). The patients were highly selected and there is little data to show whether adding somatostatin to traditional conservative treatment, has truly been able to speed up healing of biliary fistulae. In fact is not clear whether the authors have used Somatostatin as an adjunct to conservative management, combined to Percutaneous drainage and eventual ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) +/- biliary stent or if Somatostin was the only treatment besides TPN, therefore allowing avoidance of Percutaneous drainage and/or ERCP +/- biliary stent. The major limitation of this study is not only to have a small and limited sample size but is also being conducted in a non-randomized fashion. The true evidence supporting evidence of the use and efficacy of somatostatin in speeding up and eventually increasing the success rate of healing of biliary fistulas, can only be achieved by a randomized controlled trial where the biliary fistula cases in stable, non peritonitic and not severely septic patients, would be randomized either to traditional conservative treatment, including Percutaneous drainage and/or ERCP +/- biliary stent on one arm (Control group) and to traditional conservative treatment, including Percutaneous drainage and/or ERCP +/- biliary stent with the ADJUNCT of Somatostatin, on the other arm of the study (Study group), and see if the latest group will show a significantly higher success rate in fistula healing and/or a significantly shorter time to resolution of biliary leak. Therefore further studies with large number of patients, especially studies in the form of randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish the true role of somatostatin in the treatment of post HPB surgery bile leak. Bile fistula after HPB surgery occurs most commonly after laparoscopic cholecystectomy with injuries to the biliary system [2], from failure of biliary-enteric anastomosis [3] and from peripheral bile duct leakage after liver transaction [4]. The initial management of a patient with bile leak after HPB surgery is to find out its underlying cause and to control sepsis. Some causes of severe injury to the bile duct need operative repair while those with minor injury can be treated with conservative treatment and to wait for the leakage site to heal. Somatostatin is suitable for the latter group of patients only, but not for all patients with bile leak after HPB surgery. Furthermore, somatostatin should be only part of a multimodal conservative treatment which should include sepsis control with antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of intraperitoneal collections if present, eventual ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy and/or biliary stent placement for an effective biliary drainage, nutritional support with total parental nutrition for fasting patients, and close monitoring [5]. Last but not least the cost if Somatostatin treatment and its influence on the health care expenses, should be further investigated and a careful cost-efficacy analysis and appropriateness assessment should be performed before giving a definitive recommendation. Complete cessation of bile leak cannot be used as an end-point to define success of conservative treatment. It has to be combined with clinical and radiological findings to define success. Complete cessation of bile leak can be a consequence of healing of the skin wound of biliary fistula with increased intraperitoneal bile collection as bile leak continues from the leakage site. Alternatively, complete cessations of bile leak can be a result of scaring at the bile duct which leads to complete obstruction of the biliary system proximal to the site of leakage. Although there is cessation in bile leak, the patient can be in serious trouble as a consequence of bile duct obstruction. We look forward to see if these encouraging results from this preliminary study will stimulate further research on this important subject and the findings will be ventually confirmed."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:22:34Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Editorial"}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-18","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-18","titles":[{"title":"Editorial Commentary On ''Somatostatin Infusions Reduce Post-Operative Cholorrhoea After Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery: An Observational Preliminary Study''"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8029","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:09Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8029","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Eighteen rats were used; the animals were divided into three groups of six rats each. Group 1 served as the control which was fed with normal feed. Group 2 was diabetic untreated rats (DM) while group 3 was OG treated diabetic rats (DMT). At the end of 28 days, the intestinal transit and motility were determined using graded doses of acetylcholine, adrenaline and atropine. Results: The DMT intestine showed greater increase in contraction with increase in concentration of acetylcholine, application of adrenaline showed that the ileum of the DMT had a significantly lower (P=.001) percentage change in relaxation when compared to control or DM groups but there was no significant difference between DM and control group. While atropine caused a significant increase (P=.001) in percentage change in relaxation in the DMT group when compared to control and DM groups.

Results: The average basal pressure was 6.5±0.6 mm Hg in the rectum and 44.5±1.5 mm Hg in the anal canal (mean ± s.e.m.). These indices were not dependent on the general health conditions and the clinical manifestations of IBS. However the threshold of reflective sensitivity was significantly greater (28.4±2.2 ml) in patients with chronic constipation associated with organic bowel disease compared with patients suffering from IBS with functional constipation (20.5±2.8 ml) and diarrhea (22.5 + 2.8 ml). Conclusion: Anorectal manometry is a sensitive and specific method to differentiate IBS from organic bowel disease. The most informative test is anorectal manometry using rectal balloon slowly filled with water."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:23:15Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Iritable bowel syndrome;"},{"subject":"anorectal manometry;"},{"subject":"chronic constipation;"},{"subject":"diarrhea;"},{"subject":"children."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-06-16","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-06-16","titles":[{"title":"The State Of Anorectal Zone As A Marker Of Functional And Organic Gastrointestinal Disorders"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8031","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:09Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8031","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

This study investigated the feasibility of using a validated postgraduate assessment methodology in an undergraduate setting; The Toronto Patient Assessment &amp; Management Exam (PAME). Methods: A standardised patient-centred multifaceted healthcare pathway examination consisting of 4 separate consecutive encounters was piloted in the final year of undergraduate training. The entire final year medical class was invited to participate. The final sample of 25 was selected on a consecutive, volunteer basis. Student’s experienced 2 standardised simulated cases; 1 medical, 1 surgical. Candidates were examined by 2 independent examiners (subject experts) and were ranked on a Global Rating Scale. Passing standard was set at 3/5 - ‘barely adequate for Intern/PGY1’ but with the addition of second pass criteria of avoidance of an egregious error. Results: 23 students completed the examination. Two arrived late and were excluded. 21/23 demonstrated knowledge and skills at least at minimum expected standard. 18/23 avoided an egregious error. Subgroup analysis identified better performance in the assessment and management of the medical case and the review encounter (encounter 4) was the lowest scoring in both cases. The format was well received by students and examiners. Conclusion: The use of an alternative certification examination ‘ACE’ based on a postgraduate format ‘PAME’ in undergraduate setting appears feasible and discriminatory. Inclusion in the pass criteria of avoidance of egregious error appears to improve the specificity of the examination. The ACE format reveals potential to replace elements of prepractice (PGY1) clinical barrier assessment."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:23:50Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Assessment;"},{"subject":"competence;"},{"subject":"validity;"},{"subject":"safety to practice;"},{"subject":"medical graduates."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-06-16","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-06-16","titles":[{"title":"An Alternative Certification Examination 'Ace': Can Post Graduate Methods Be Used To Assess Clinical Skills In Medical Under Graduates"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8033","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:09Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8033","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

We review research showing evanescent opening of the blood‐brain barrier, BBB, after electroconvulsive treatment, ECT. ECT as currently used in psychiatry for treatment‐resistant depression has been in continuous use throughout the world since introduction in the late 1930’s. Post-ictal BBB opening phenomenon might be safe enough to use to deliver chemotherapeutic agents that would not otherwise cross the BBB. Although the main mass of tumor in glioblastoma has a relatively leaky BBB, the invasive paucicellular migratory microsatellite glioblastoma cells that become the origin of recurrent tumor are supplied by normal poorly‐permeable capillaries, preventing ready access of potentially useful chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin or methotrexate. These microsatellites go on to kill. Modern ECT uses deep neuromuscular blockade and cardiovascular stabilizing drugs such that muscular contractions and increases in intracranial pressure are minimized, yet the electroencephalogram shows a typical grand mal seizure. Post‐ECT BBB opening allows transgression of &gt; 4 kDa peptides, potentially comfortable enough to give free access to brain tissue of doxorubicin or methotrexate for example. Even drugs that are said to cross the BBB, such as temozolomide, the current mainstay chemotherapy drug in glioblastoma, do so only at ~20% of plasma levels. Many potentially useful drugs achieve brain tissue levels &lt;1% of blood levels. We conclude that if careful step-wise study can establish safety, by delivering chemotherapy immediately after ECT we may open new and more effective treatment avenues for glioblastoma."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:24:08Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Blood-brain barrier;"},{"subject":"chemotherapy;"},{"subject":"electroconvulsive treatment;"},{"subject":"glioblastoma."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-06-16","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-06-16","titles":[{"title":"Ect As Used In Psychiatry Temporarily Opens The Blood-Brain Barrier: Could This Be Used To Better Deliver Chemotherapy For Glioblastoma"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8034","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:10Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8034","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Circulating PCT levels decrease when the infection is controlled by the host immune system or antibiotic therapy. The present study was conducted to measure the diagnostic and prognostic utility of procalcitonin in tuberculosis. Methodology: The study group consisted of forty patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and forty normal controls (NC). Blood was collected from NC and PTB (labeled as PTB-0). Patients underwent the 4-drug chemotherapy for 2 months following which blood was collected again (labeled as PTB-2). They were continued into the next 4 months of the 2-drug regimen. Blood was collected thereafter and labeled as PTB-6. All blood samples were semiquantitatively analyzed for procalcitonin. Results: Serum PCT was &lt; 0.5 ng/ml in thirty seven out of forty normal controls and &gt; 2 ng/ml in three. The prohormone level was &gt; 2ng/ml in fifteen and &gt; 10 ng/ml in the rest of the PTB-0 subjects, thus indicating that PCT levels served as a useful marker of infection in PTB patients at diagnosis. After 2 months of intensive treatment the number of patients with PCT levels &gt; 10 ng/ml increased to thirty two in PTB-2. Only 8 patients recorded plasma PCT levels &gt; 2 ng/ml. At the end of 6 months of treatment, PCT values in all patients had decreased to &lt; 2 ng/ml. Conclusion: Serum PCT seemed to show diagnostic and prognostic utility at the end of treatment however, PCT is not specific for tuberculosis alone and may be raised in other lung infections.

Aside from a few reported adverse effects, tea, particularly green tea, appears to be beneficial for human health. In the case described herein, a male experienced several transient ischemic attack-like symptoms immediately following the consumption of a cup of high quality oolong tea. A thorough medical evaluation uncovered no evidence of such an attack and leads to the suggestion of a heretofore unreported response to oolong tea. Presentation of Case: A 72-year old male with hypertension and atrial fibrillation, who takes valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide to control hypertension and warfarin to reduce the risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism, presented at the emergency room of a local hospital describing several transient ischemic attack-like symptoms immediately after consuming a cup of oolong tea. His symptoms included presyncope, disequilibrium, bilateral hand parathesias, mild dysphasia, and visual problems (but apparently not presbyopia or amaurosis fugax), all of which had disappeared in approximately two hours after drinking the tea. (Mild presyncope was previously noted by the patient when ingesting a strong green tea.) No unusual features emerged from his physical examination, and his blood work was unremarkable except for elevation of his partial thromboplastin time (39 sec) and prothrombin time (22.5 sec), giving an international reference of 2.0, all consistent with the effects of warfarin. A battery of tests by the emergency room physician, a cardiologist, and a neurologist, e.g. electrocardiogram, brain computerized tomography, 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram, brain magnetic resonance imaging, with and without 20 ml Gadolinium, and a magnetic resonance angiogram, confirmed the earlier diagnosis of atrial fibrillation but disclosed no additional malfunction in his heart. His brain showed no evidence of a prior hemorrhage, and his carotid arteries were clear. Methodology and Results: Analysis of the oolong tea by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry identified the major catechins and two methylxanthines, caffeine and theophylline, as well as other constituents, but there was no evidence of any extraneous chemicals that could lead to the symptoms. Conclusion: In view of the rapid onset of symptoms after the consumption of oolong tea, bilateral as opposed to unilateral parathesis, and the absence of any evidence of a hemorrhage or the presence of impurities in the tea, we suggest that the transient ischemic attack-like symptoms could possibly be attributable to one or more components of the oolong tea and was not an atypical magnetic resonance imaging-negative transient ischemic attack."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:25:00Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Transient ischemic attack;"},{"subject":"oolong tea;"},{"subject":"mass spectrometry;"},{"subject":"high performance liquid chromatography."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-18","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-18","titles":[{"title":"A Possible Effect Of Concentrated Oolong Tea Causing Transient Ischemic Attack-Like Symptoms"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8037","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:10Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8037","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design/Methodologies: Using four different methodologies, the anti-oxidant/free radical scavenging activities of COLEX were determined in comparison with standard antioxidants, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). For the hepatoprotection study, four groups of rats were used. Groups A: Control group given distilled water only; B: Given NaAsO2 at 2.5 mg•kg-1 bw/day (p.o.) for 2 weeks; C: Administered COLEX alone at 200 mg•kg-1 bw a day for 2 weeks (p.o.); D: Pre-treated with COLEX for 2 weeks followed by NaAsO2. The activities of the enzymes aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ- glutamyl transferase (γGT) were determined in the treated and control animals as indices of hepatotoxicity. Place and Duration of the Study: The animal treatment and analyses were carried out at Department of Biochemistry, University of Ibadan between February and June 2008. Results: At 25, 40 and 50 μg•ml-1 concentrations of the extracts or the antioxidants, the reducing power is of the order BHA &gt; BHT &gt; COLEX. At 50 μg•ml-1, the percentage inhibitions of peroxidation by COLEX, BHA and BHT were respectively 96.2%, 97.3% and 98.4% while percentage DPPH scavenging effect of COLEX, BHA and BHT were 62.5%, 67.5% and 61.3% respectively.

Place and Duration of Study: The Emergency Department (ED) of Interim Louisiana State University Public Hospital, the level one trauma center in New Orleans, from September 2006 to June 2010. Methodology: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients intubated in the ED during the study period. Demographic, physiologic and procedural data had been previously recorded on a worksheet immediately following each intubation. In July 2008, residents received a lecture on management strategies for the DA and participated in simulation exercises based on DA scenarios. A detailed checklist of DA predictors was added to the standard intubation form, and completed by the resident prior to each intubation. Procedural outcomes were compared for number of attempts, time to successful intubation, faculty involvement and use of adjunct devices for the pre-and post-intervention periods using generalized estimating equations and z statistics. Results: There were 266 intubations in the pre-intervention period and 373 in the postintervention period. 50.3% of post-intervention intubations met criteria for DA. Time to successful intubation did not vary between the two groups (11.6 minutes pre; 10.8 post, P=0.30). There was no significant difference in the number of attempts (1.4 pre; 1.3 post, P =0.44) or faculty interventions (1.5 v. 3.75%) or the number of successful intubations that were assisted by adjuncts (P =0.22). Success on the second attempt was more likely if an adjunct was used (P =0.24).

Discussion: EC generally appear like a firm, usually painless swelling that sometimes raises the tongue. In the differential diagnosis of the EC the clinician has to consider a wide range of pathologic conditions that could be classified as development, neoplastic and infective pathologies. Surgical enucleation is the only effective treatment for these kinds of lesions and prognosis is very good, with a very low incidence of relapse.

Study Design: This study was descriptive and cross-sectional. Place and Duration of the Study: Participants were randomly selected in Yaounde, Nkongsamba and Foumban from January 2009 to October 2012. Methodology: It involved 7042 Cameroonians of both sexes aged 18-85 years old. Blood pressure categories were defined using the 7th report of Joint National committee on hypertension. Hypertension subtypes were defined as Isolated Systolic Hypertension (ISH) [Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)≥140 mmHg and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) &lt; 90 mm Hg]; Isolated Diastolic Hypertension (IDH) (SBP&lt;140 and DBP≥90); Systodiastolic Hypertension (SDH) (SBP≥140 and (DBP) ≥ 90). Participants were classified based on their body mass index (BMI) as obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), overweight (25 ≤BMI≤ 29.9) and normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI ≤ 24.9). Results: Close to 1/3 of individuals (2089) were pre-hypertensive (28.03% women vs 31.30% men, P&lt;.001). 14.3% participants (14.28 % women and 14.32% men, P = .05) already suffering from hypertension stage 2, were diagnosed for the first time. IDH and SDH were the predominant subtypes: IDH (44.23% or 3115 participants), SDH (34.07%) vs ISH (21.7%) and varied with BMI classes. Distribution of frequencies (%) was the following for Normal weight: ISH (30.8%); IDH (41.3%), SDH (27.9%). Overweight: ISH (18.9%); IDH (46.8%), SDH (34.2%). Obese: ISH (15.3%); IDH (44.6%), SDH (40%). Fatness and waist circumference were predictors of IDH and ISH respectively. Conclusion: Obesity was associated with HTN in all age groups and both sexes. IDH and SDH in Cameroon are not only associated with increasing age, but also are prevalent in most cases of obesity induced HTN.

Study Design: Rats in individual cages were exposed to ultrasonic irradiation for 21 days. Place and Duration of Study: V.P. Serbsky National Recearh Center For Social and Forensic Psychiatry, Department of Basic and Applied Neurobiology, Moscow, Russian Federation, between November 2012 and January 2013. Methodology: 48male non-pedigree albino rats were divided into 5 groups: nonultrasound- saline, ultrasound-saline, ultrasound-fluoxetine, ultrasound-bupropion and ultrasound-tianeptine. After 21 days of irradiation social interaction test, forced swimming test and sucrose preference test (anhedonia test) were conducted. Than rats were decapitated and prefrontal cortex were taken for RT-qPCR gene expression analysis of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5HT1B, 5HT2B receptors and SERT. Results: Depression-like behavior manifests itself in reduced social activity in social interaction test, increased immobility in forced swimming test and lower sucrose consumption in anhedonia test. The administrated antidepressants demonstrated their effectiveness, except for bupropion in the social interaction test. RT-qPCR gene expression analysis showed reduced expression of 5HT2A receptor gene and increased expression of SERT gene in the prefrontal cortex of rats stressed with ultrasonic radiation. Conclusion: The obtained data allow to conclude that further investigations with lager number of animals, extended tests battery may allow to claim that this model meets the main requirements set to animal models (face, predictive and construct validity) and can be used in studies of depression-like disorders caused by a situation of informational uncertainty and in pre-clinical development of new antidepressants."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:26:46Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Ultrasonic radiation;"},{"subject":"animal model;"},{"subject":"5-HT2A receptor;"},{"subject":"SERT;"},{"subject":"behavior;"},{"subject":"antidepressants;"},{"subject":"rats."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-18","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-18","titles":[{"title":"Behavioral Patterns And Expression Of Genes Coding Serotonin Receptors In Rats With Ultrasound Induced Depression"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8043","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:11Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8043","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The country’s pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) treatment program is now standardized according to international scale. Under the national standardized PTB treatment system, the regimen for new PTB patients consists of a 2-month intensive treatment phase with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, followed by a 4-month continuation phase with rifampicin and isoniazid. Aims: To determine and analyse the annual PTB treatment success and incidence rates, treatment defaulters’ rate, and pulmonary tuberculosis mortality from 1992 to 2002 under the DOTS program at the Germany Leprosy Relief Association’s (GLRA) 13 regional diagnostic centers and chest clinics in Sierra Leone and to compare this data with the annual national tuberculosis data stored in WHO tuberculosis database covering the period 1992-2010. Study Design: The study retrospectively analysed pulmonary tuberculosis annual incidence rates for study subjects who registered for diagnosis and later for treatment at the GLRA 13 regional diagnostic centers and chest clinics from 1992 to 2002. From these data we were able to determine the treatment success and defaulters’ rates, and PTB mortality for these subjects. We also analysed data of the annual national tuberculosis incidence and success rates, and mortality rates retrieved from World Health Organisation (WHO) TB data for Sierra Leone for the period 1992-2010. Twenty six (26) healthcare service providers were also interviewed for additional information about the main cause of mortality and reasons for treatment defaults among pulmonary tuberculosis patients during the period under investigation. Study Subjects: A total of 2,958 (1,881 men and 1,077 females) mostly adults of age range 15-65 years were diagnosed and later treated for pulmonary tuberculosis from 1992 to 2002 at the various GLRA diagnostic and treatment centers in the country. Setting: The study was a multicenter study conducted at the Germany Leprosy Relief Association’s (GLRA) main referral diagnostic center and chest clinic at Lakka in Freetown and the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Njala University in Bo, Sierra Leone. Pulmonary tuberculosis treatment outcomes data used in this study were obtained from TB patients who were admitted at various GLRA chest clinics in Sierra Leone from 1991-2002. Data analysis and literature reviews were done at the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Njala University in Bo, Sierra Leone from 2011 to 2012. Results: The most important finding of this investigation was that the annual pulmonary tuberculosis incidence and treatment success rates (% cured rate and % completed treatment rate) rose significantly during the period under review for both the GLRA’s study subjects and the cases stored in the WHO tuberculosis database. Conclusion: The significantly high and growing number of annual PTB incidence rates during this HIV/AIDS epidemic reinforces the need for routine PTB treatment monitoring and supervision as well as compulsory HIV testing for tuberculosis patients seeking treatment."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:27:06Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Prevalence;"},{"subject":"drug resistance;"},{"subject":"completed treatment;"},{"subject":"treatment defaulters."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-12","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-12","titles":[{"title":"Evolutionary Trends For Pulmonary Tuberculosis Treatment Using Dots In Sierra Leone: 1992-2010 Database Study"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8044","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:11Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8044","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Accurate assessment of tumour KRM status in pancreatobiiary tumours is relevant in an era of targeted molecular therapies. Aim: To assess KRM in tumour and non-tumourous margin tissue in patients undergoing a pancreatic resection. Study Design: Original research, retrospective review of prospectively collected specimens. Place and Duration of Study: Patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatic resection at the Royal Adelaide Hospital from 2011-2012 were consented for the study. Methods: Patient demographics, background history and tumour details were collated. Tumour tissue and margin areas were macrodissected from FFPE tissue sections following identification by a pathologist. DNA was prepared from the tissue using the QIAamp FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden Germany). KRM at codons 12 and 13 was assessed using SNaPShot TM (Applied Biosystems, Warrington UK) in tumour tissue and non-tumourous margin tissue. Fourteen patients were included in the study. The median age of the patients in the study was 68 (range 57-86) years. The M : F ratio was 8 : 6. Results: Twelve patients had adenocarcinomas (5 pancreatic; 4 ampullary, 3 biliary) and two had benign mucinous tumours. Six patients with adenocarcinomas had KRM (5@codon 12 and 1@codon 13). Margin tissue was negative for KRM in all the tested patients (p&lt;0.016 Fisher) particularly, in those with tumour KRM. Tumours with KRM were associated with larger tumours 30(22-65) mm vs 20(15-35) mm [median(range)](p = .045 – MW-U). Nodal disease occurred in 6/6 with KRM vs 2/6 without KRM (p = .61 – Fisher). Conclusions: KRM is a local tumour event and not a field change. This suggests that testing for KRM should be reliant on tumour tissue and not surrounding normal margin tissue. KRM was associated with larger malignant tumours and a trend towards nodal disease."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:27:23Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Biliary cancer;"},{"subject":"KRAS mutation;"},{"subject":"margin status;"},{"subject":"pancreatic cancer;"},{"subject":"ampullary cancer;"},{"subject":"prognosis."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-12","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-12","titles":[{"title":"Kras Mutation Is A Local Tumour Event And Not A Field Change In Pancreatobiliary Tumours"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8045","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:11Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8045","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study design: Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impacts (acid precipitation, ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect or global warming) are comprehensively discussed in this article. Place and Duration of Study: National Centre for Research, Energy Research Institute (ERI), between January 2011 and July 2011. Methodology: An approach is needed to integrate renewable energies in a way to meet high building performance. However, because renewable energy sources are stochastic and geographically diffuse, their ability to match demand is determined by adoption of one of the following two approaches: the utilisation of a capture area greater than that occupied by the community to be supplied, or the reduction of the community’s energy demands to a level commensurate with the locally available renewable resources. Results: The adoption of green or sustainable approaches to the way in which society is run is seen as an important strategy in finding a solution to the energy problem. The key factors to reducing and controlling CO2, which is the major contributor to global warming, are the use of alternative approaches to energy generation and the exploration of how these alternatives are used today and may be used in the future as green energy sources. Conclusion: This global warming will eventually lead to substantial changes in the world’s climate, which will, in turn, have a major impact on human life and the built environment. Therefore, effort has to be made to reduce fossil energy use and to promote green energies, particularly in the building sector. Energy use reductions can be achieved by minimising the energy demand, by rational energy use, by recovering heat and the use of more green energies."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:29:34Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Renewable energy;"},{"subject":"environment;"},{"subject":"sustainable development;"},{"subject":"global warming."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-07-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-07-31","titles":[{"title":"Energy And Environment: Applications And Sustainable Development"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8052","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:12Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8052","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

It purposefully administered questionnaire to managers of all SHG in the study area to establish their socio-economic characteristics, contributions to community greening and motivating factors behind their SHI. The study found that the horticulturists were nearly males (93.7%), young adults (54.0%), earning about three dollars per day (63.6%), have been in practice for more than four years (79.3%) and altogether using about 1.5% of land in the study area for SHG. A good number of them have contributed to voluntary greening of their communities through planting of trees (76.2%), hedges and shrubs (47.6%) and flowering plants (65.1%). The horticulturists’ Motivating Index (HMI) employed to know why they went into the practice revealed that they (51%) were moved by the depreciating state of urban green (HMI=2.55) and feared (46.4%) the impending ecological doom on the built environment due to lack of sufficient green space, causing global warming (HMI=2.32). This could be why the linear regression test of the preference of social to economic value of the practice of SHG in the study area has its R2 to be 0.219. This means that SHG in the area did not necessarily bring positive economic value to the horticulturists as the social value embedded in it. This study is a prove that literature and publicities on environmental effects of global reduction in green space seem to be yielding positive results in Africa as some individuals in the study area are taking into self-help initiatives in community greening, even where land seemed very scarce for such development. It concludes that literature on the subject should be more encouraged."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:29:51Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Urban green;"},{"subject":"horticultural gardens;"},{"subject":"communities;"},{"subject":"green space;"},{"subject":"self-help initiative."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-08-12","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-08-12","titles":[{"title":"Community Approach To Growing Greener Cities Through Self-Help Street Horticultural Gardens: A Case Study Of Lagos, Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8053","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:12Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8053","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Sterile amber coloured bottles were used to collect 10 replicate borehole water samples from the mainland and fixed with concentrated H2SO4. Samples were transferred to the laboratory in iced coolers and analyzed using Gas chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The interactions of the PAH components detected was determined using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r) while spatial variance equality in means of concentrations was explored with the One-way ANOVA. Structure detection of observed inequalities was made with means plots. Concentrations of the PAHs were high and exceeded the WHO maximum permissible limit of 0.002mg/l in drinking water. Benzo(b)fluoranthene, with the highest mean concentration varied between 0.00037- 0.51266 (0.08117±0.03330159)mg/l, fluoranthene varied between 0.00060-0.32890 (0.0473946±0.01769877)mg/l, while benzo(k)fluoranthene with the least mean concentration varied between 0.00017-0.08478 (0.0237385±0.00610045)mg/l. However, pyrene concentration ranged between 0.00015 and 0.24757 (0.0508440±0.01859716)mg/l, benzo(a)anthracene between 0.00020-0.21972 (0.0512660±0.01688275)mg/l, and chrysene between 0.00013 and 0.16571 (0.0488975±0.01090264)mg/l. Strong associations were observed between all the PAH components measured at P&lt;0.01. Significant heterogeneity in mean variance of the PAHs [F(211.9502)&gt;Fcrit(3.921478)] was recorded across the sampling locations at P&lt;0.05. Structure detection of mean difference revealed that the inequalities were most contributed in BH1, BH 2, BH 5 and BH 10, while equality in mean concentrations were observed between BH 1 and BH 4, and BH 5 and BH 6. BH 8 recorded the highest contamination level of the various PAHs due basically to its proximity to the refinery’s effluent channel. The most probable source of these PAHs is therefore the nearby Port Harcourt Refinery Company’s effluent discharges into the surrounding creeks of the mainland. This contamination is of public health concern as several PAHs are known carcinogens. It is recommended that advanced technological engineering be applied to contain the presence of these pollutants in drinking water sources of residents of the area."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:30:09Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons;"},{"subject":"carcinogens;"},{"subject":"Okrika mainland;"},{"subject":"Nigerian delta;"},{"subject":"refinery effluents."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-07-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-07-31","titles":[{"title":"Determination Of The Contamination Of Groundwater Sources In Okrika Mainland With Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons (Pahs)"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8054","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:12Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8054","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

An increase of 880 TWh of electricity consumption in transport in 2030 compared with the Reference Scenario, of which 90% occurs in PLDVs, results in about 250 Mt of additional CO2 emissions. The rise in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is 1.0 – 3.50C (1PCC, 2007a). If emissions of greenhouse gases, and in particular CO2, continue unabated the enhanced greenhouse effect may alter the world’s climate system irreversibly. This review attempted to examine how climate change constitutes a threat to food security and environmental conservation. Climate change (CC) refers to changes in modern climate. It reflects abnormal variations to the expected climate within the earth’s atmosphere and subsequent effects on other parts of the earth. It is emphasized that CC poses a threat to food security as it impacts on natural systems and resources through erratic rainfall patterns, heightened temperature and susceptibility to pest and disease outbreaks hence decreasing crop yields and consequently increased hunger. CC negatively affects biodiversity conservation and management through exacerbated drought conditions, increased risk of wildfires leading to some extreme events like heat, waves, river and coastal flooding, landslides, storms, hurricanes and tornadoes which culminate in environmental degradation. For its effects to be reduced establishment of more forest plantations and maintenance of the existing natural and artificial forests should be encouraged. Saving biodiversity in the form of standing forests and interact lands can help prevent climate change and help communities and natural areas cope with a changing planet. At the same time, helping nature become more reification climate change through a combination of management restoration and protection strategies will help prepare places, plants, animals and people for climatic change successful adoption of living system can help ensure their ability to support the needs of people and better withstand future changes."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:30:26Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Climate change;"},{"subject":"greenhouse gas;"},{"subject":"food security;"},{"subject":"biodiversity decimation;"},{"subject":"environmental degradation;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-06-27","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-06-27","titles":[{"title":"Global Climate Change: A Threat To Food Security And Environmental Conservation"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8055","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:12Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8055","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The catchment covering an area of 9000 km2 includes a small dam called Oyan dam having an effective watershed area of 40 km2 with a gross storage of 270 million cubic meters. Hydrology of the area was characterized on the basis of land use, rainfall, temperature, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and runoff using meteorological data. Different methods like rainfall coefficient method is used to determine monthly distribution of rainfall including rainy and dry months; Penman method to calculate evaporation from the reservoir; Thornthwaite method and Thornthwaite water balance model to determine potential and actual evapotranspiration; and runoff coefficient method to estimate runoff. The catchment is characterized by one rainy season and two dry seasons during the year. The rainy season has five months duration and dry season seven months. The mean annual rainfall of the catchment is 1015.09 mm, out of which rainy season accounts for 96.1% and the dry season for 3.9%. The total annual water loss by evaporation from the reservoir is 1178.5 mm. The mean annual actual evapotranspiration for the catchment is 899.3 mm.

If emissions of greenhouse gases, and in particular CO2, continue unabated the enhanced greenhouse effect may alter the world’s climate system irreversibly. Total emissions of greenhouse gases, across all sectors, were 42.4 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2-eq in 2005. Energy sector, accounts for 84% of global CO2 emissions and 64% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. Energy-related CO2 emissions rise from 28.8 Gt in 2007 to 34.5 Gt in 2020 and 40.2 Gt in 2030. Global percapita emissions of energy-related CO2 in 2007 was 4.4 tonnes. Higher growth of automobiles and consumption of petroleum products is invariably attended by concerns of pollution and climate changes. Global fleet of passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) is estimated to increase from 770 million in 2007 to 1.4 billion in 2030. Among all sectors that emit CO2, the transport sector is the fastest growing, representing from 22% to 24% of global GHG emissions from fossil fuel sources, second only to the industrial sector. World emissions of NOx were 82 Mt in 2007, of which Road transport was responsible for about one-third of NOx emissions. Only Road transport related CO2 emission is estimated to increase from 4.8 Gt in 2007 to 6.9 Gt in 2030. The increase in CO2 emissions is largely a result of increasing demand for individual mobility in developing countries. There are strong efforts and renewed investments by manufacturers and suppliers in providing solutions to the CO2 reduction challenge. Low-carbon vehicles, such as hybrid cars, plug-in hybrids and electric cars, have received widespread public attention recently. It is estimated that share of hybrids in the global fleet will reach about 5% by 2020 and almost 8% by 2030, up from just 0.15% in 2007. Plug-in hybrids and electric cars will constitute only 0.2% of the global fleet in 2030. But increase in electricity consumption in road transport in future due to increased penetration of plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles, sees transport sector CO2 savings partially offset by power generation emissions. An estimated increase of 880 TWh of electricity consumption in transport in 2030, of which 90% occurs in PLDVs, will result in about 250 Mt of additional CO2 emissions. Authors forecasted that the use of environmentfriendly and clean technologies is going to make all the difference between the winners and the losers of the industry. It is noted that current policies are insufficient to prevent a rapid increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is recommended that policy makers and researchers should give more emphasis on ‘cost-effectiveness as most important factor to reduce automotive GHG emission reduction’. It is also concluded that CO2 savings will be maximized if well-to-wheel impact is clearly addressed at all stages of the fuel and energy chain."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:32:11Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Global warming;"},{"subject":"greenhouse gases;"},{"subject":"road transport;"},{"subject":"hybrid vehicle."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-04-17","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-04-17","titles":[{"title":"Critical Review Of Trends In Ghg Emissions From Global Automotive Sector"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8061","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:13Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8061","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

We performed an analysis of data of the charts of all unfavorable PCa (uPCa) treated with the combination of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Study Design: Retrospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Radiation Oncology (AC Camargo Vancer Center), São Paulo, Brazil, between 1997 and 2010. Methodology: The data of all uPCa treated between 1997 and 2010 were evaluated. Ethnicity definition was based on 3 categorizations: Black, White and Asiatic. We included 229 patients (age range 47-83 years). The median follow-up was 70.3 months (range, 36 –155 months). There were 7.4% (17) Asiatic, 79.0% (181) Whiten and 13.6% (31) Black patients. Results: EBRT and HDR doses ranged from 40 to 54 Gy and 16 to 30 Gy given in 4 fractions, respectively. Actuarial 5- and 10-year overall and disease free survical (DFS) rates were 87.6%, 61.3%, 90.9% and 54.2%, respectively. On univariate analysis prognostic factors related to improved DFS were White/Asiatic race (p&lt;0.001), initial clinical stage p=0.004, HDR&gt;20Gy (p&lt;0.001) and Gleason-Score&lt;7 (p&lt;0.001). On multivariate analysis race (p=0.037), late clinical satge (p=0.038) and HDR&lt;20Gy (p&lt;0.001) were associated with biochemical failure. Conclusion: An association with aggressive PCa was observed in Black when compared to White/Asiatic patients. Already known predictive factors of biochemical failure were confirmed in our analysis. Improved DFS was related to HDR dose escalation.

Methodology: We included 150 patients (age ranged 45-65 years) with post-operative nausea and vomiting after abdominal hysterectomy, their body mass index was less than 30 kg/m2 without medical history of gastrointestinal diseases. Patients were equally divided into three groups. Group (A), received trancutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS10Hz was applied on the P6 point of the dominant hand 30min before induction of anesthesia and continued for 8 h postoperatively) in addition to post operative anti-emetic drug. In group (B), acupressure (elastic wrist bands with a sphere to apply pressure on P6 point) was performed exactly in the same way as in group (A) in addition to post operative anti-emetic drug. Patients of group (C) received post operative anti-emetic drug only. Post-operative metoclopramid 10mg/iv was administrated for all patients in groups (A, B &amp; C) as antiemetic. Assessment of all patients in all groups (A, B&amp;C;) was carried out after 4h and 8h of the treatment through Mc Gill assessment for postoperative nausea and vomiting. Results: Showed a statistically more significant decrease (P&lt;.0001) in nausea and vomiting scales for group A than both groups B&amp;C; after 4 and 8 hours.

Several studies were published on the association between FXIII 34Leu allele and a decreased incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) with high controversy results dependent on the population. The aim of our study was to further investigate the possible protective role of the FXIII 34Leu allele polymorphism against acute MI in Egyptian patients. Study Design: Clinical examination by cardiologist specialists, blood test for biochemical markers and DNA genotyping using specific molecular sensing probes in Real Time PCR. Place and Duration of Study: Patients were recruited from consecutive admission to the coronary care unit, Suez Canal University Hospital, Ismailia, Egypt. Material and Methods: Total 107 subjects were recruited and subdivided into two main groups; patients (82) and control group (25). On admission, the following data were fulfilled: age, smoking, history of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Hypertension (HTN), family history of MI. Clinical examination: Blood pressure and Body Mass Index calculation were done and for patients a short outcome prognosis was done using left ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF). Routine laboratory investigations for recruited groups including fasting and postprandial glucose level, Triglycerides, total Cholesterol, HDL-C and LDLC were carried out.

Study Design: Prospective rater blinded randomised trial. Place and Duration of Study: Sample: ED of Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Methodology: 100 patients presenting with self-harm to the ED will be randomised to receive treatment as usual plus supportive and interactive text messages for three months or to receive treatment as usual. Patients in both groups will be followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months to ascertain frequency and intensity of thoughts of self-harm and selfharming behaviour. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using SPSS version 20 for Windows with descriptive statistics, student’s t-test, ANOVA analysis and chi-square tests. Results: We hypothesize that supportive, informative and interactive text messages delivered to patients discharged from an ED after an episode of self-harm will significantly reduce the frequency and intensity of thoughts of self-harm and self-harming behaviour in patients compared with those receiving only follow-up treatment as usual. A secondary hypothesis is that patients receiving the text messages will report an overall satisfaction with the text messaging system. Conclusion: This is a low cost, simple strategy which, if shown to have a significant impact on reducing rates of self-harming thoughts and behaviours in patients who have self-harmed, will allow progress in an area of great clinical importance.

Mexican children have been shown to consume limited amounts of fruit and vegetables. The purpose of the current study is to determine whether the inclusion of eggs in the diet increases plasma carotenoids in this population. Study Design: This study is a follow up on the effects of high egg intake on plasma lipids and atherogenic lipoproteins in children. Fifty four Mexican children (25 boys/29 girls) aged 8-12 y were randomly assigned to consume either 2 eggs/d (518 mg additional dietary cholesterol) (EGG period) or the equivalent amount of egg whites (SUB Period) in a cross-over design for 4 wk. After a 3 wk washout, children were crossed over to the alternate treatment. Methodology: 3-day dietary records, plasma carotenoids and apolipoproteins were measured at the end of the EGG and SUB Periods. Results: In agreement with the lack of effects of eggs in increasing atherogenic lipoprotein profiles, plasma apolipoprotein B concentrations did not change between periods indicating that increases in plasma cholesterol were not associated with higher number of LDL particles. Although the values for apo C-III were high compared to other pediatric populations, they were not affected by egg intake. Dietary records indicated low intake of carotenoids, especially during the SUB period. Plasma lutein and zeaxanthin were increased during the EGG period from 0.235 ± 0.071 to 0.280 ± 0.147 μmol/L (P&lt;0.001) and 0.044 ± 0.019 to 0.051 ± 0.031 μmol/L (P&lt;0.001), respectively.

Infections with one of these viruses can facilitate infection with the other. In Jamaica cervical cancer is seen in 27.5 per 100, 000 women making it the second leading cause of cancer death in this population only to breast cancer as a cause of death in women with cancer. Our study investigates the seroprevalence of anti-HIV antibodies in women with abnormal pap smears in Jamaica to determine the influence of HIV on cervical dysplasia. Only patients with positive confirmatory tests were classified as HIV positive. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used for screening while the Western blot was used for confirmation. Sero-prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies in women with abnormal pap smears was 0.85%. The preliminary results of HIV seroprevalence in women with abnormal pap smears may be low in Jamaica because of the success of the HIV/AIDS programme. A larger study can be done in the future and be representative of the Jamaica population, since the present study has as a limitation a smaller number of controls in comparison to cases. The findings reported do not support the hypothesis that HPV infection facilitates HIV infection in the studied population. It is the first study of its class reported in the Caribbean. It has been postulated that HPV infections may account for the cervical dysplasia despite the low prevalence of HIV association in the women with abnormal pap smears and that persistent HPV and to a lesser extent the HIV is responsible for the prevalence of abnormal pap smears in Jamaica. A limitation of the study was that the control group was smaller than that expected for 3 million’s population but a larger study can be done in the future."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:34:24Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Cervical cancer;"},{"subject":"cervical dysplasia;"},{"subject":"Jamaica;"},{"subject":"HIV;"},{"subject":"HPV;"},{"subject":"ELISA;"},{"subject":"seroprevalence."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-23","titles":[{"title":"Seroprevalence Of Anti-Hiv Antibodies In Women With Abnormal Pap Smears In Jamaica"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8068","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:14Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8068","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

From the researchers’ perspective, the whole research process consists of the follow stages: data discovery, data access, data processing, data analysis and result dissemination. The aim of paper is to review the state-of-the-art of geospatial data systems to reveal the way towards a better support of global change studies. Methodology: This paper reviews the capabilities of exemplar geospatial data systems. It further analyzes the needs of manipulating large volume of diverse data when performing global change studies. By comparing the available capabilities with the real needs, this study shows the strengths and limitations of existing data systems when supporting global change studies. Results: The analysis shows that data systems are helpful for researchers to fulfill data discovery and access, while most of them do not provide further functionalities to cover other stages in the whole research process. This suggests that a new generation of data systems is highly needed to provide efficient and enough support for scientists to perform global change studies. Instead of simply moving data from sources to researchers’ local archives, it will enable more on-line data manipulation functionality and the interoperability of data and systems. Conclusion: Traditional geospatial data systems are designed to operate locally without built-in interoperability and sharing capabilities. Such systems are operated under the paradigm of “everything-locally-owned-and-operated”. Conducting global change studies using such a system requires moving a large volume of data from providers’ sites to researchers’ site. Such a system does not provide strong support for the entire research process. Since climate research requires manipulating a huge volume of complex and diverse multi-source data, a new paradigm of “everything-shared-over-the-Web” is promising when designing a new generation of geospatial data systems, which are standard-based, interoperable, and sharable, for global change studies."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:35:33Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Global change studies;"},{"subject":"research process;"},{"subject":"earth observation;"},{"subject":"cyberinfrastructure;"},{"subject":"global earth observation system of systems."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-01-30","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-01-30","titles":[{"title":"Review Of Geospatial Data Systems' Support Of Global Change Studies"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8072","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:14Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8072","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The sustainability of groundwater resources is crucial for regional and local communities, which is intimately tied to the changing recharge rate. To accurately assess the recharge rate, different methods were used to estimate hydraulic conductivity of an unconfined aquifer in this study. Particle size method with four empirical formulae, together with in-situ aquifer tests and the inverse modelling techniques were integrated to evaluate their potential for the determination of hydraulic conductivity of unconsolidated aquifer materials in order to improve groundwater recharge estimation. Results showed a wide disparity between the granulometric estimates of the hydraulic conductivity and the in-situ and modelling techniques. Slug test values range from 5.13 x 10-6 m/s to 4.96 x 10- 5 m/s whereas the infiltration test (Porchet method) results vary from 1.91 x 10-7 m/s to 1.16 x 10-6 m/s. The simulated hydraulic conductivity values range from 2.54 x 10-7 m/s to 6.36 x 10-7 m/s, with a decreasing trend in the northeast-southwest (NE-SW) direction. The infiltration method appeared to be better than the granulometric one in the estimation of the vertical hydraulic conductivity within the unsaturated zone of porous formations. This study also pointed out that within an anisotropic formation, the hydraulic conductivity ratio (Kv/Kh) should not always be taken as equal to 10. Specific tests should be implemented to access this value in a given aquifer.The inverse modelling results showed the net recharge values varying from 68.5 mm/yr to 180 mm/yr. The modelling technique appears to be consistent with the in-situ estimates. Therefore, the application of groundwater modelling tool in this study has shown excellent promise for characterizing the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity and net recharge values within the targeted aquifer system."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:36:09Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Grain size;"},{"subject":"hydraulic conductivity;"},{"subject":"slug test;"},{"subject":"inverse modelling;"},{"subject":"Yaounde."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-01-19","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-01-19","titles":[{"title":"Comparative Analysis For Estimating Hydraulic Conductivity Values To Improve The Estimation Of Groundwater Recharge In Yaounde- Cameroon"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8074","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:14Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8074","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: Temporal trends were evaluated at annual, seasonal and monthly time scale using Mann-Kendall method. Significant trends were identified at annual, seasonal and monthly scale using two tailed Z-Test. The temporal trends were evaluated using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. To quantify the slope we used Sen’s non-parametric estimator of slope. The significance of the test was evaluated using two tailed Z-Test. A p value of &lt;0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance, using two tailed Z test. Results: Climate warming was significant in the recent decades in the Indian Cardamom Hills, which is recognized as one of the ecologically sensitive and biologically diverse areas. Considerable and significant spatial and temporal variations have occurred in the main climatic elements like air temperature, rainfall and relative humidity in the hill region. Significant positive trend in day-night time temperature has been observed and the trend differed from one station to another. Significant increasing trend was also observed for minimum temperature than maximum temperature and this had caused decline in diurnal temperature. Both winter and summer monsoon rainfall as well as high relative humidity had a positive influence on the yield of cardamom. However, the variability in these two types of rainfall was high for the entire region and the trend is negative. The variability of monthly mean precipitation is high for May, December and January under AR4 climate scenario. Conclusion: The sustainable yield of cardamom may be possible only when the winter and summer rainfall variabilities were minimal. Increasing trend of soil temperature from 0-10 cm depth was recorded, which was significant at 5 cm depth and can cause considerable negative implications for sustainable cardamom production both in terms of reduced soil moisture availability and altered pest population dynamics."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:36:27Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Temperature;"},{"subject":"rainfall;"},{"subject":"relative humidity;"},{"subject":"soil temperature;"},{"subject":"cardamom."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-01-19","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-01-19","titles":[{"title":"Present And Future Climate Change In Indian Cardamom Hills: Implications For Cardamom Production And Sustainability"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8075","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:14Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8075","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

It is recognized that methods for the assessment are subject to various sources of uncertainty (choice of climate model and emission scenario, course spatial and temporal scales, etc.). This study investigates the climate change related uncertainty in the frequency of flood flows for the Upper Thames River basin (Ontario, Canada) using a wide range of climate models. Climate model outputs are downscaled using the change factor approach for 30-year time slices centered on years 2020, 2050 and 2080. To estimate natural variability, a stochastic weather generator is used to produce synthetic time series for each horizon and for each climate scenario. A number of realizations out of historical range are also produced for the 1979-2005 baselines using the weather generator. A continuous daily hydrologic model was then used to generate daily flow series for the baseline and for the future time horizons. A peak-over-threshold (POT) with Generalized Pareto Distribution is used to produce flood frequency curves for the four time horizons. The uncertainty involved with the POT modelling is also considered. The results indicate that use of unbounded GPD model should be employed for flood frequency analysis. A large uncertainty exists in all the projected future design floods. Probabilistic assessment of the uncertainty is carried out and it provides the estimation of flood magnitude-return period relationship with high level of confidence."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:37:02Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Flood frequency;"},{"subject":"climate change;"},{"subject":"uncertainty;"},{"subject":"peak-over-threshold;"},{"subject":"hydrology;"},{"subject":"river flow."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-01-19","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-01-19","titles":[{"title":"Assessment Of Uncertainty In Flood Flows Under Climate Change Impacts In The Upper Thames River Basin, Canada"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8077","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:15Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8077","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

In fact, Nigeria was once covered by widespread vegetation comprising of humid tropical forests in the south and savannah grasslands in the north rich in biodiversity. A great percentage of this luxurious vegetation has been cleared by the pressures mounted by human activities with eventual degradation. In terms of methods, the paper uses mixscale approach based on descriptive statistics, temporal spatial analysis and mapping, and photographic images to analyze the trends associated with tropical deforestation. The results show visible changes in the form of large scale decline of Nigeria’s forest landscape over the years. This resulted in the disappearance of forest resources and vegetation cover with mounting threats to sensitive natural areas. Aside from the socio-economic elements linked with the problem, community efforts at the margin using agroforestry systems showed some promise with many benefits to stem the tide of deforestation.

The analysis was carried out in 2011for the system that is composed of a treatment procedure collecting the treated oil for re-refining, followed by the production of expanded clay and recycling for electricity production. Methodology: Carbon footprint analysis was conducted by using the Umberto software 5.5 based on the concepts of life cycle assessment with respect to international standards (ISO). Within this context, the substances considered for such carbon footprint analysis are directly relevant to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). Results: The results showed that managing waste oils may contribute to the reduction of carbon footprint due to the avoided emissions of greenhouse gas through the reuse of treated waste oils. The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from collection and treatment of waste oils would not outweigh such benefit earned from the substitution of virgin lubricant oil even though the use of treated waste oils for producing expanded clay may end up some more carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion: The carbon footprint analysis in this study has shown the potential for improvements in the waste oil management system in Portugal. The most significant improvement that could be made is the increase of using treated waste oils for the expanded clay production.

Study Design: Test and modify the models by using five years of snow measurements from Harp Lake. Place and Duration of Study: Dorset Environmental Science Centre, Ontario Ministry of Environment, and Department of Geography, Nipissing University, between January 2009 and August 2012. Methodology: The old daily-run WINTER model was the first model. It was modified to create a second model. The enhanced-temperature-index (ETI) model was slightly modified to be the third model. Modified WINTER and ETI were combined into the fourth model. Hydrology model BROOK90 and SWAT were used as the fifth and sixth model, also daily-run. Operating the WINTER and ETI in hourly steps created the seventh and eighth model. The calculated snow water equivalent (SWE) by each model was evaluated against the observed data to give a coefficient of efficiency (CE). Accuracy and performance of the models were compared based on CE values. Results: Modified WINTER model improved original WINTER by 20.7% (CE increased 20.7%). The performance of ETI model was 27.6% higher than the original WINTER. The new combination model produced additional improvement by 40.7 % over the original WINTER, or by 16.5% over the modified WINTER or 10.3% over the ETI. Running the model with hourly time steps rather than daily steps increased model’s accuracy: hourly WINTER raised CE by 15.4% and hourly ETI raised CE by 7.9%. Two watershed hydrology models BROOK90 and SWAT performed even better than the above six simpler snow models. Conclusion: It is suggested that the daily combination model be considered if only daily data is available, or hourly WINTER and ETI models be used if hourly runs are desired while new calibration are required when applying them to any new locations.

Elsewhere, camels are used differently, i.e. for their products (milk, agricultural work) rather than for their traditional uses (packing or riding). On the other hand, facing more contrasted crop ecosystems and an unbalanced climate, which seem to contribute to emerging diseases with complex and often unknown aetiologies, caused high unexplained deaths.

A socio-economic profile of the respondents indicated that 48.89% were above 45 years of age and majority (78.23%) had educational qualifications below the secondary school level. The study also revealed that a majority (79.12%) of the respondents were small-scale farm holders and more than half (67.56%) had fewer than 7 extension contacts during the 2010 farming season. An analysis of the source of climate change awareness revealed that majority (82.22%) of the respondents was aware of the phenomenon of climate change. Of that number, extension service and friends/neighbors were ranked high as source of awareness about climate change, accounting for 47.57% and 232.43% respectively. Analysis of adaptation practices used by the respondents showed that planting ahead of rains (97.78%) and planting of cover crops 80.00% were used most. Analysis of the relationships between some selected socio-economic variables and the use of climate change adaptation measures revealed that educational qualification and the number of extension contacts were the most important factors influencing the use of adaptation measures among the respondents. The main constraints on climate change adaptation measures by farmers in the study area were poor financial resources (86.67%) and unavailability of weather information (77.78%). The study concluded that the majority of farmers were aware of climate change and its consequences. The study also concluded that although the majority of farmers were engaged in husbandry practices aimed at climate change adaptation, they were constrained by some factors; therefore we recommended that extension education should be strengthened to boost farmers’ awareness of climate change and prepare them for adaptation measures and that appropriate/indigenous technologies be promoted for adaptation by farmers."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:38:52Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Awareness;"},{"subject":"adaptation;"},{"subject":"climate change;"},{"subject":"farmers;"},{"subject":"Borno State."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-07-30","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-07-30","titles":[{"title":"Analysis Of Awareness And Adaptation To Climate Change Among Farmers In The Sahel Savannah Agro-Ecological Zone Of Borno State, Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8083","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:15Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8083","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Out of the nine sizes of cultured fish feed samples examined, E. coli was found in eight while one had S. aureus. Four of the samples had both E. coli and S. aureus. Bacterial counts from Coppens feed was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than bacterial counts from Dizengolf and Durante fish feeds which had counts not significantly different (P&gt;0.05) from each other. No fungus was found. Results obtained show that fish feeds sold in Asaba may have microbial flora with bacteria as the dominant microorganism.

A three dimensional hydrodynamic model using Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) was developed and used to analyze complex and dynamic flow, salinity, and temperature distributions in the system. The external driving forces for the model include the river discharges from natural and urban watersheds, atmospheric winds, and astronomical tidal elevations at the open boundaries where flow exchange takes place. Simulated water surface elevation, temperature, and salinity were compared against the field data at several observation stations in 2008 and 2009 with good agreement (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.92 between the measured and the modeled water surface elevations). The calibrated EFDC model was used to examine responses of the system to high, mean, and low inflows from streams and the sea level rise in the open boundaries under climate change. The concept of the age of water was applied to understand pollutant transport in the system. The age of water reveals dynamic and complex interactions between tides from the Gulf of Mexico and inflows from the streams. The age of water is less than 20 days under the 2-year high inflows and up to 160 days under 7Q10 low inflows. Under mean inflow conditions, the age of the tracer released from Wolf Bay is 50–70 days in the lower Perdido Bay and larger than that in the upper Perdido Bay, indicating a strong interaction between tides and inflows, which results in recirculation of flow and pollutants.

The lowest soil bulk density of 1.34 and 1.20 g cm-3 were obtained in the unburnt dumpsite in 2007 and 2008 resulting to 12% and 20% decline in 2007 and 2008 in the unburnt dumpsite relative to cropped land. The total porosity and gravimetric moisture content was a reverse of the soil bulk density. Higher total porosity and gravimetric moisture content were obtained in the unburnt and burnt dumpsites in that order relative to the fallow and cropped land. Infiltration rate followed the same trends as total porosity of the various sites. The lowest infiltration rate 15.02 and 35.82 mmhr-1 was observed in the cropped land. The soil pH decreased with depth in the dump and non-dumpsite but became strongly acid at 30 – 60 cm and 60 – 90 cm depths. The order of soil organic matter content was unburnt dumpsite &gt; burnt dumpsite &gt; fallow &gt; cropped land. The available P and exchangeable K and Ca were highest in the burnt dumpsite. Heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Fe, and Pb) increased with time in the burnt and unburnt dumpsites but decreased in the cropped land. More concentration of heavy metals was observed in the 0 – 30 cm soil depth. The relative performance of maize grown on soils of the dump and non-dumpsites showed that there was better growth in the dump sites soils. However, the concentrations of heavy metals on tissue were found to be within normal range. Therefore, long term dumping of sawmill waste can influence soil properties and productivity."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:41:48Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Burnt dumpsite;"},{"subject":"cropped land;"},{"subject":"fallow;"},{"subject":"heavy metals;"},{"subject":"timber sawmill and unburnt dumpsite."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-31","titles":[{"title":"Changes In Physical And Chemical Properties Of Soil In Timber Sawmill Dumpsite In Abakaliki, Abakaliki Southeastern, Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8094","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:16Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8094","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

In particular, road to stream connectivity via gullied pathways as well as via diffuse overland flow can contribute to significant fine sediment inputs to forest streams. At present in the State forests of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, road drainage spacings are determined on the basis of road slope. In this study forest road surveys were conducted across seven coastal catchments near Coffs Harbour on the sub-tropical NSW mid north coast to determine connectivity between gravel roads and streams via channelised and diffuse pathways under a range of rainfall intensities. A total of 10.82 km of representative road sections was assessed, comprising 129 relief pipes and 22 mitre drains. Of the 151 drains surveyed, gullies were evident at the outlets of 26 relief pipes (20.2%) but at none of the mitre drains. Relationships previously derived between contributing road length and hillslope gradient, and between contributing area and hillslope gradient adequately predicted thresholds of gully formation at drain outlets. During lower intensity storms with average recurrence intervals of 10 years or less, less than 20% of drains are connected to streams via overland flowpaths. However, the degree of diffuse connectivity increases when contributing area takes account of table drains and cut batters, as well as with increasing rainfall intensity. We conclude that when constructing new roads or reassessing drainage on existing roads in forest environments, in addition to preventing erosion of the road surface, gully formation and connectivity with streams via diffuse overland flow should be avoided. This requires factoring in contributing area, hillslope gradient at drain outlets and distance to the nearest stream. Preventing or reducing road-to-stream connectivity is essential for reducing impacts on water quality across all land tenures."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:42:06Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Road drainage;"},{"subject":"sediment connectivity;"},{"subject":"forest management;"},{"subject":"water quality;"},{"subject":"southeastern Australia."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-31","titles":[{"title":"Road To Stream Connectivity: Implications For Forest Water Quality In A Sub-Tropical Climate"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8095","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:16Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8095","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: Civil Engineering Department, National Central University, Zhongli, Taiwan, China, between May and July 2011. Methodology: In a wind tunnel, wind speed was increased incrementally from 0 to 2, 4, 6, and 8 m s–1, then decreased from 8 to 0 m s–1. To examine how sap flow responded to unsteady wind, we estimated the time constant of each individual for each step change in wind speed. Moreover, we examined differences in transpiration rate and leaf conductance among individuals under stable wind speeds. Results: The time constant was generally about 30 min in both conifers and broadleaved individuals. Interestingly, under steady winds, transpiration rate showed two different response patterns to increased wind speed: linear and saturated. The two patterns may be a consequence of different stomatal conductance values, but not of different leaf shapes. Conclusion: Our results suggested that neither hydraulic system nor leaf shape differences between coniferous and broad-leaved trees was an ultimate factor affecting the transient response of tree sap flux and transpiration to wind speed, and that stomatal conductance played an important role in transpiration regulation in response to wind speed."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:43:02Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Transient response;"},{"subject":"transpiration rate;"},{"subject":"stomatal conductance;"},{"subject":"conifers;"},{"subject":"broadleaved tree species."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-31","titles":[{"title":"Wind Speed Response Of Sap Flow In Five Subtropical Trees Based On Wind Tunnel Experiments"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8098","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:17Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8098","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: A pot experiment was carried out. The soil was treated with different levels of crude oil: 1, 2 and 3% v/w either alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers. Results: Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration increased in jojoba leaves when grown in petroleum oil polluted soil especially at 2% and 3% crude oil. It was noted that, Na, Mg and Ca decreased while K increased in shoots of jojoba. In roots Na and Ca increased however K and Mg decreased with increasing crude oil concentration in the soil. Heavy metals, Cu, Mn, Cd and Pb increased in both shoot and root with increasing crude oil concentration while, Zn decreased comparing with the control. In soil, N and K decreased meanwhile Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn as well as organic matter increased with increasing crude oil concentration. Soil was free from P while, the addition of inorganic fertilizers improved P content. Bacterial account was significantly increased at the end of the experiment at 1% and 2% crude oil especially after addition of inorganic fertilizers. The electric conductivity and MDA of the leaves increased with increasing crude oil concentration. The addition of inorganic fertilizers to crude oil contaminated soil decreased the electric conductivity and MDA comparing with crude oil only. Conclusion: The observed changes in composition of mineral elements in jojoba plants in the present study could be attributed to the cell injury and disruption in the cell membrane, heavy metal accumulation and toxic nature of the petroleum oil.

Study Design: This study intercompares theoretical models that predict the relative efficiency of the latent heat (evapotranspiration) with respect to the sensible heat flux. Model predictions are compared with field measurements over surface covers with different physical characteristics and soil water availability. Place and Duration of Study: This study was carried out at the Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, between August 2012 and December 2012. Methodology: Three theoretical models for prediction of the relative efficiency of the latent heat were investigated, based on the lumped heat transfer (Priestley), the linear stability analysis (LSA) and the maximum entropy principle (MEP), respectively. Model predictions were compared against field measurements over three different land cover types, viz. water, grassland and suburban surfaces. An explicit moisture availability parameter β is incorporated in the MEP model, to facilitate direct comparison against the LSA and field measurements. Standard post-processing and quality control were applied to field measured turbulent fluxes using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique. To be consistent with the premise of all theoretical models, diurnal series of sensible and latent heat fluxes were filtered such that only data points under convective conditions were selected. Results: Among all three models, the application of Priestley model is restricted to saturated land surfaces, and generally overestimates the relative efficiency of the latent heat for water-limited surfaces. The LSA and MEP models predict similar β ranges, i.e., 0.05-0.3 in summer and 0.1-0.7 in winter over suburban area, and 0.1 to 0.5 over lake surface. Over vegetated surfaces, the MEP model predicts a reasonable β range around unity by taking transpiration into consideration, while the LSA model consistently underestimated the relative efficiency. Conclusion: Moisture availability plays an essential role in regulating the surface energy partitioning process.

An ensemble of 16 Global Climate Models data under different emissions scenarios are used in this study. The basin is expected to receive an increase in precipitation in all scenarios; from 5% to 15% by theend of this century compared to the base period 1990-1999. However, a 2 to 5ºC increase in temperature is expected to create an overall drier climate with reduced runoffs. The decadal averaged seasonal trends show that all major hydrological components except the runoff are expected to increase. An increase in temperature, together with more precipitation, could significantly increase actual evapotranspiration, ultimately may result a decrease in runoff by 14% and 18% in the 2020s and 2090s respectively compared to the base period. The elasticity analysis showed that the change in runoff is more sensitive to a change in temperature than precipitation for the 2060s and 2090s; and suggested that temperature will continue to be the dominating factor in future climate. In general, Nzoia will very likely experience a drier climate, further exacerbating the biomass production and food security."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:44:30Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Climate change;"},{"subject":"hydrology;"},{"subject":"arid climate;"},{"subject":"climate elasticity;"},{"subject":"food security;"},{"subject":"drought."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-10","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-10","titles":[{"title":"Will Nzoia Basin In Kenya See Water Deficiency In Coming Decades As A Result Of Climate Change"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8103","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:17Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8103","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The results show that the rises of sea level and river base during the warm Holocene period has led to an overall increase in groundwater arsenic concentration due to the development of reducing geochemical conditions and sluggish groundwater movement. Modeling results indicate that the intrusion of seawater occurring during high sea-level stand may lead to desorption of arsenic from surface of hydrous oxides due to pH effects and ionic competition for mineral sorbing sites.

This study investigated the nanoscale distribution of reactive functional groups and the binding of cations on the surface of micron-size BC particles, identified the key processes, and explored the sources of surface functionality and their relative contribution to cation exchange capacity (CEC). Materials and Methods: Elemental microprobe and synchrotron-based Scanning Transmission X-ray Spectromicroscopy (STXM) coupled with Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy were used for nano-scale mapping of cations and reactive functional groups, and further distinction of the sources of reactive functional groups generated either by oxidation of BC surfaces or by adsorption of non- BC organic matter onto the BC surfaces. Their respective contribution to cation adsorption was obtained using a depth profile of a BC-rich Anthrosol from the central Amazon, Brazil. Results and Discussion: Adsorption of Non-BC organic matter is more dominant on the surface of BC particle in topsoil as evidenced by a stronger signal of microbial biomass and humic substances extracts. In comparison, a greater level of oxidation was found on the outerlayer of BC particles in subsoil horizons. Organic C in subsoils was found to generate 23-42% more CEC per unit C than topsoil. Based on CEC per unit C, the capacity of BC in creating CEC was 6-7 times higher than Non-BC, and the BC in deeper horizons had up to 20% higher CEC than the topsoil horizon. Near BC surfaces, higher ratios of Ca/C and K/C in subsoil than topsoil horizons reinforce the observation that BC in subsoil horizons had a higher capacity in binding cations and creating CEC than in the topsoil horizon. Conclusions: Oxidation of BC is suggested to be more efficient and important for creating CEC than the adsorption of non-BC onto BC surfaces, thus identified as being key for BC surface functionality and nutrient retention in Amazon Anthrosols."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:45:04Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Adsorption; black carbon;"},{"subject":"nutrient retention;"},{"subject":"oxidation;"},{"subject":"surface functionality;"},{"subject":"synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray spectromicroscopy (STXM);"},{"subject":"near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-10","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-10","titles":[{"title":"Oxidation Is Key For Black Carbon Surface Functionality And Nutrient Retention In Amazon Anthrosols"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8105","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:18Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8105","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

It increased food production but also destroyed the ‘physical, chemical and the biological properties’ of soil over the years of use. It killed the beneficial soil organisms and also impaired the power of ‘biological resistance’ in crops making them more susceptible to pests and diseases. No farmland of world is free of toxic pesticides today. Over the years it has worked like a ‘slow poison’ for the soil and society. According to UNEP and WHO nearly 3 million people suffer from ‘acute pesticide poisoning’ and some 10 to 20 thousand people die every year from it in both the developed and the developing countries. Organic farming by earthworms (Sir Charles Darwin’s ‘friends of farmers’) can provide a sustainable and also highly economical solution to the various problems created by the destructive agrochemicals in farm production. Earthworms vermicompost are scientifically proving to be an ‘extraordinary powerful growth promoters and protectors’ for crops (5-7 times over other bulky organic fertilizers and 20-40 % higher over chemical fertilizers). They are rich in NKP, micronutrients, beneficial soil microbes like ‘nitrogen-fixing’ and ‘phosphate solubilizing’ bacteria, ‘mycorrhizal fungi’, humus and growth hormones – auxins, gibberlins and cytokinins. It has very high ‘porosity’, ‘aeration’, ‘drainage’ and ‘water holding capacity’ and makes the soil soft. More significantly it also protect plants against various pests and diseases either by suppressing or repelling them or by inducing biological resistance in plants to fight them or by killing them by their beneficial microbes (chitin and cellulose degraders). ‘Vermiwash’ (liquid filtered through the body of worms) and the ‘vermicompost tea’ (solution of vermicompost) also works as very ‘powerful biopesticides’ eliminating the use of toxic chemical pesticides. Agriculture has also been responsible for huge emissions of greenhouse gases and induction of global warming. Of the increase of atmospheric carbon over the last 150 years, about a third (33.3 %) is thought to have come from agriculture. Chemical agriculture has further augmented GHG emissions. From their production in factories to their transport and use in farms agrochemicals generate huge toxic wastes and pollution and greenhouse gases. Aggressive tillage of compacted soils (due to use of agrochemicals) depletes the ‘soil organic carbon’ (SOC) and emits large volumes of CO2. Chemical nitrogen from the soil is oxidised as N2O which is 312 times more powerful GHG than CO2. Organic farming by vermicompost ‘sequesters’ large amount of ‘atmospheric carbon’ and bury them back into the soil as SOC improving soil fertility and also ‘mitigating global warming’. Soil amended with vermicompost have significantly greater ‘soil bulk density’ and hence porous and lighter and never get compacted needing no or low tillage. Production of vermicompost divert huge amount of wastes from ‘landfills’ which emit large amount of powerful greenhouse gases like CH4 and N2O along with CO2. Every 1 kg of waste diverted from landfills prevents 1 kg of greenhouse gas emission equivalent to CO2. It is like a ‘win-win situation’ for the nation, farmers, environment and the society. The objectives of this review paper is to scientifically prove that vermiculture technology with the aid of earthworms and its metabolic products (vermicast) can boost farm production without agrochemicals (completely organic) and justify the beliefs of Sir Charles Darwin who called the earthworms as ‘friends of farmers’ centuries ago. Besides, it will provide several social, economic and environmental benefits to the society by way of producing ‘chemical-free’ safe, ‘nutritive and protective’ foods (even against some forms of cancers) for the people, salvaging human wastes and reducing the needs for costly landfills, mitigating global warming by sequestering carbon into soil."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:45:22Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Vermiculture and organic farming;"},{"subject":"high food production without agrochemicals;"},{"subject":"chemical-free, safe, nutritive and protective foods;"},{"subject":"soil carbon sequestration and fertility improvement;"},{"subject":"mitigation of global warming;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-09-09","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-09-09","titles":[{"title":"Organic Farming By Vermiculture: Producing Safe, Nutritive And Protective Foods By Earthworms (Charles Darwin'S Friends Of Farmers)"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8106","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:18Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8106","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The results showed that during the fiber cell wall thickening and fiber strength formation stage (25-50 days post-anthesis, DPA), there was an interactive effect between planting date and boll position.

Ninemonth- old nursery olive plants were inoculated with a non-defoliating (VCG4B, ND) or a defoliating (VCG1, D) isolate of V. dahliae. Resistance was evaluated by assessing symptom severity using a 0-4 rating scale and estimating the area under disease progress curves. Interaction between isolates of V. dahliae with different pathotypes and olive cultivars show that the defoliate pathotype cause higher disease severity index and stem colonization (p&lt; 0.01). The percentage of plants killed and of those which recovered from the disease and stem colonization Index were used as additional parameters for including a particular cultivar into a defined category. One cultivar, ‘Bladi’, were susceptible or extremely susceptible to both pathotypes of V. dahliae. A second group showed differences of resistance depending on the pathotype used. They were susceptible or extremely susceptible to the D pathotype but resistant or moderately susceptible to the ND one. Finally, ‘Kalamon’ and ‘Koroneiki’ were resistant to both pathotypes of the pathogen.

Methodology: Analysis of combining ability by using Griffing's method II Diallel crossing scheme after elimination of the control treatments. KWS scale from 1 to 9 (1= healthy plants and 9 = maximum injury) was used to estimation of resistance to Cercospora disease. Results: General combining ability of O-types was significant for potassium, alpha amino nitrogen and alkalinity at 1% and for resistance to Bolting and Cercospora, molassed sugar, root yield, sugar yield and white sugar yield at 5% probability levels. Also, specific combining ability was significant for resistance to Bolting, potassium, root yield and sugar yield at 1% and for resistance to Cercospora and white sugar yield at 5% probability levels. Conclusion: Additive and non-additive gene effects control the expression of resistance to Cercospora and white sugar yield. Also, resistance to Bolting was found to be mainly determined by the non-additive gene effects. The best parent and hybrid for resistance to Cercospora were RR607 and RR607 × 452, respectively.

The crop occupies a crucial place than other cereal crops since it is used as food, feed, fodder and other industrial raw material. The aim of this study was to conduct a comparative study on the productivity of hybrid and open-pollinated maize, with the participation of farmers in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna state. Precisely, it evaluated the current hybrid and open-pollinated maize production technologies by describing their major socioeconomic factors, and most importantly identifying the economic difference between hybrid and open-pollinated maize, using the farm survey data collected from 160 maize farming communities in October- December for the cropping year 2009-’10. The result of analysis of resource use efficiency of hybrid and openpollinated maize showed that all resources were inefficiently utilized because the ratios were not equal to one. The resource use efficiency of hybrid and open pollinated maize production in the study area was computed from Efficiency ratio r i.e., the ratio of MVP (Marginal Value Product) and MFC (Marginal Factor Cost). The ratio indicates that sampled farmers underutilized fertilizer and insecticides. The efficiency ratio for seeds, labour and herbicides were less than one showing that the sampled farmers over-utilized seeds, labour and herbicides on the farms. This study suggested the need to bring more area under hybrid maize cultivation.

Typically, they are distributed worldwide and parasitize nearly every species of higher plant. Due to their endoparasitic way of living and feeding, root knot nematodes disrupt the physiology of the plant and may reduce crop yield and product quality and, therefore, are of great economic importance and make control necessary. Field studies were conducted in 2008 and 2009 to determine yield loss of cowpea (cv. ART98-12) due to natural infestation by M. incognita using Carbofuran 3G at 2kg a.i./ha and untreated as check. The yield of cowpea was found to be higher with the application of nematicide-Carbofuran 3G at 2kg a.i. /ha. The percentage increase over control was 39.0 and 33.0% in the years 2008 and 2009, respectively. A significant reduction in the yield of cowpea in untreated plots was mainly attributed to direct damage of the root system by the feeding of root-knot nematode, M. incognita. The root knot nematode population in carbofuran treated plots was significantly lower than in check in the two years, also at harvest. In the check the nematodes reproduced many folds during the cropping season. Higher nematode population in the untreated check decreased plant growth and consequently reduced the number of harvested seeds and other agronomic parameters."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:51:00Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Carbofuran;"},{"subject":"Cowpea;"},{"subject":"field conditions;"},{"subject":"Meloidogyne incognita;"},{"subject":"root-knot nematode;"},{"subject":"yield loss;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-02-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-02-28","titles":[{"title":"Assessment Of Yield Loss Of Cowpea (Vigna Unguiculata L.)

Our experimental objective was to evaluate the effects of varying levels of Spirulina supplementation, sire breed and gender on liveweight and body conformation traits. We utilized a complete randomized block experimental design balanced by 4 sire breeds, 3 supplementation levels and 2 sexes in which weaned prime lambs with an average liveweight of 37.6 ± 5.2 kg and body condition score of 3.1 ± 0.4 at 6 months of age were balanced by sire breed and gender and randomly allocated into 3 treatments (8 lambs per treatment) – the control group grazing without Spirulina (0%), low (10%wt/vol) and high (20%wt/vol) Spirulina. Lambs in the low and high Spirulina treatment groups were drenched daily with Spirulina prior to being released for grazing with the control group of lambs over a 6-week trial period, following a 3-week adjustment phase. Weekly measurements of chest girth, withers height, body length, body condition score and liveweight were taken. Mixed linear model procedures in SAS with sire breed, sex, Spirulina level and their second order interactions as fixed effects and sire as a random variable, were used for statistical analysis. Spirulina level significantly influenced lamb liveweight (P&lt;0.018), body condition score (P&lt;0.001) and body length (P&lt;0.015). Lambs on Spirulina levels of 10% recorded the highest mean liveweight of 41.9 ± 0.7 kg. Spirulina levels of 20% did not significantly improve liveweight compared to the control group (0%). Highly significant sire breed interactions with Spirulina level (P&lt;0.001) resulted in the heaviest (47.08 kg) and lightest (35.14 kg) average liveweights in Black Suffolk-sired crossbreds and purebred Merino lambs respectively, supplemented at the 20% Spirulina level. Body conformation (P&lt;0.001) and liveweight (P&lt;0.014) responses to Spirulina supplementation significantly varied between ewe and wether lambs. It was evident that a cost-effective supplementation strategy with Spirulina for optimal liveweight gains in weaner lambs was achieved at the 10% level. These findings will aid sheep farmers in making informed choices about appropriate sire breed and gender combinations in their enterprises when supplementing with Spirulina for growth improvement as a strategic pathway for the early attainment of market weights in prime lambs.

N fertilization rates, flowering dates, and N fertilization rates × flowering dates significantly (P ≤ 0.05) affected NA and the formation of fiber length, strength, maturity and micronaire. N fertilization rates affected fiber quality by influencing NA which was significantly related to rate and duration of the fiber quality formation process. The optimal NA for fiber quality formation was varied. For bolls flowering before August 25, when mean daily temperature during boll maturation period (MDTBMP) was higher than 21°C, NA in the 240 kg N ha-1 treatment was optimal for fiber length, fiber strength, maturity, and micronaire formation. For bolls flowering after September 10 when MDTBMP was lower than 21°C, NA in the 480 kg N ha-1 treatment was optimal for fiber quality development. Higher N application rate can sustain a higher NA level in its subtending leaf, leading to the less decrease magnitude of fiber length, strength, maturity, micronaire in late flowering dates. 240 kg N ha-1 is the recommended N application strategy for optimal quality, but we could diminish the negative influence of climate stress on fiber quality by supplemented N fertilizer in later flowering season."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:51:52Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Cotton;"},{"subject":"nitrogen rates;"},{"subject":"flowering dates;"},{"subject":"NA; fiber length;"},{"subject":"fiber strength;"},{"subject":"fiber maturity;"},{"subject":"fiber micronaire."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-01-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-01-28","titles":[{"title":"Effect Of Nitrogen Rates And Flowering Dates On Fiber Quality Of Cotton (Gossypium Hirsutum L.)"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8128","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:21Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8128","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

In spite the availability of a number of CMD resistant cultivars, several local landraces are continually grown in Uganda because they possess certain desirable traits, which may not have been fully met by the resistant varieties. Field based trials were setup to evaluate the response to CMD of some landraces that became prominent after the 1990s CMD pandemic. Experiments were located in areas where CMD is reported to have subsided namely, Mukono (Central Uganda) and Bulindi (Western Uganda). Three landraces were evaluated per site along with resistant (Nase 4) and susceptible (Bao) standards. Plots were planted with materials obtained from either diseased or healthy fields. The results showed differences in sensitivity to CMD among varieties tested, with landraces consistently having higher CMD incidences than Nase 4. The landraces tested in Mukono were more susceptible to CMD than even the Bao, while at Bulindi on the other hand, only Sibampale proved to be more resistant than Bao. There were differences in the whitefly populations among the cassava varieties and locations. High whitefly populations characterized all landraces and Nase 4. In most tested varieties, there was a higher infestation of whiteflies on healthy than diseased plants. Low spread of CMD among local landraces was observed in Bulindi as would be expected in areas where CMD has almost subsided (low pressure areas). However, in Mukono, disease spread among landraces was very rapid and high CMD incidences reaching 100% were recorded regardless of whether plots were planted with healthy or diseased cuttings suggesting it to be a CMD hot-spot. Thus, the use of clean planting materials as an effective phytosanitary method can only be employed under low disease pressure while high disease pressure areas need use of resistant varieties."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:52:09Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Cassava mosaic disease;"},{"subject":"local landraces;"},{"subject":"CMD incidence;"},{"subject":"resistant varieties;"},{"subject":"susceptibility,"},{"subject":"phytosanitation."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-02-10","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-02-10","titles":[{"title":"Response Of Local Cassava Varieties In Uganda To Cassava Mosaic Virus Disease"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8129","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:21Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8129","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

In addition to viral elimination, tissue culture offers other advantages such as rapid multiplication of seed stock for basic seed production within a short period of time. The method is also useful for germplasm conservation. Although, in-vitro multiplication of potato was started 40 years ago and is promising, extensive use in developing countries has been limited by the high costs of media. There is thus need to explore cheaper alternatives without compromising on quality of in -vitro plantlets. A study was carried out to compare the effects of the liquid medium and solid medium on performance of three popular Kenyan potato cultivars i.e. Dutch, Kenya Sifa and Tigoni. Liquid medium consisted of Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with normal vitamins and sucrose while solid medium consisted of the same chemicals into which phytagel were added to solidify the medium. Data taken were number of roots, nodes and leaves per plantlet over time. From the results, the liquid medium gave more roots, more nodes and more leaves per plantlet than the solid medium. The results therefore indicated that liquid media have a significant effect on the plant growth. In addition, liquid medium was found to be cheaper than solid media by USD 1.65. It appears more economical to use liquid media than solid media for in vitro micro-propagation of potato. However, the experiment needs to be repeated especially with different potato cultivars so as to come up with useful recommendations."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:53:10Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Liquid medium;"},{"subject":"potato;"},{"subject":"in-vitro;"},{"subject":"plantlets."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-12-21","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-12-21","titles":[{"title":"Comparing Liquid And Solid Media On The Growth Of Plantlets From Three Kenyan Potato Cultivars"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8132","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:21Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8132","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study design: A 5 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experimental design comprising five sire breeds, two dietary protein sources, two supplementation levels and two sexes respectively, was utilized. Place and Duration of Study: University of Tasmania Farm, Cambridge, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, between April 2008 and November 2010. Methodology: Texel, Coopworth, White Suffolk, East-Friesian and Dorset sires were joined with 500 Merino ewes at a mating ratio of 1:100 in individual paddocks. Five hundred of the crossbred progeny were raised on pastures until weaning at 12 weeks of age. Forty of the weaners with an initial body weight (BW) range of 23-31 kg (average of 27 ± 3.2 kg) were fed with lupins or canola at 1 or 2% BW for 6 weeks in individual metabolic crates. CF and other wool quality traits were commercially measured at the Australian Wool Testing Authority, Melbourne. The data were analyzed in SAS using MIXED model procedures with sire fitted as a random effect, while sire breed, nutrition, supplement, level of supplementation and gender and their interactions were fitted as fixed effects. Results: CF was significantly correlated with fiber diameter (-0.89), spinning fineness (-0.95) and wool curvature (0.33). Grass-fed sheep produced wool with significantly higher comfort factor (93.1±0.3%) than supplemented sheep (CF=85.9±1.1%). Sire genetics was a significant source of CF variation; White Suffolk crosses had the highest CF (90.1±8.7) and East-Friesian crosses the least (81.5 ± 10.1%). Males fed canola at 1%BW had the highest CF (90.8 ± 7.0%), while females fed lupins at 1% BW had the least (81.1±10.8%). Conclusion: From a practical point of view, sheep farmers engaging in prime lamb production with wool comfort factor as an additional breeding objective should concentrate their effort on grass-feeding White Suffolk x Merino wethers.

The aim of the present experiment was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics, in situ rumen degradation and Aerobic Stability of whole crop barley ensiled with Urea or aqueous Ammonia. In the first experiment, Whole crop barley was harvested (35% DM), chopped, and then ensiled using laboratory silos (n= 4) as untreated (UT) or treated with urea (10, 20, 30 and 40 g kg-1 DM; U1, U2, U3 and U4, respectively) or aqueousammonia (10 and 20 g kg-1 DM; A1 and A2, respectively) for 30 days. Standard procedures were used to determine the chemical composition of the samples. The pH of the aqueous silage extract was determined using a pH meter. Ammonia-N concentration was determined in acidified silage extract (5 ml of the extract + 5 ml of 0.2 M HCl) using a distillation method. Four sheep (live weight: 44±3 kg) fitted with rumen fistulae were used. Approximately 5 g DM of each sample was placed in a polyester nylon cloth bag (10 × 12 cm, pore size of 52 μm, n=4), then incubated in the rumen for 0.0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Rumen removal bags were washed in cold running water and dried in oven (60 °C, 48 h), then weighted to determine DM disappearance. The equation of P= a+b (1-e-ct) was applied to determine the coefficients (a= quickly degradable fraction, b= slowly degradable fraction, c= fractional degradation rate constant). Both urea and anhydrous ammonia caused a significant (P &lt;0.05) increase in silage pH and NH3-N, and CP concentrations. The slowly degradable fraction (b) of the silage treated with urea was significantly (p &lt;0.05) higher than those of the untreated sample. Potential degradability of U4 was higher than other treatments. In a second experiment, whole crop barley was harvested (32.5% DM), chopped, and then ensiled (n= 4) for 35 days as untreated (UT) or treated with urea (23.4 g Kg-1DM) or aqueous ammonium (13.1 g Kg- 1DM), to obtain a final application rate of about 0.35% N of fresh forage weight. The population of yeasts and molds (colony-forming unit= CFU) was determined by spread plating of filtered extract silages on malt extract agar. Aerobic stability was defined as the time it took for the temperature in the silage masses to rise 2 °C above ambient temperature. Whileboth of urea and ammonia had no effect on the initial number of mold in the silages, these treatments significantly lowered CFU of yeast in fresh silages. In this experiment both Ammonia and urea had a significant effect on inhibition of rising temperature and yeast in aerated silages.

Study design: Bulked segregant analysis of Sorghum species and S. species hybrids. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Soil &amp; Crop Sciences; Texas A&amp;M; University; College Station, TX, USA; 2009 - 2011 Methodology: A bulked segregant analysis approach was conducted using SSRs mined from the S. bicolor genome sequence. Bulked samples of S. bicolor, typical flowering S. halepense, non-flowering tetraploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrids, and triploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrids were surveyed to identify both unique markers specific to each bulk and markers indicative of S. bicolor genetic material introgressed into the Sorghum spp. hybrids. Results: Thirty-nine and 23 markers were found to be unique to the S. bicolor and typical flowering S. halepense bulks, respectively. These unique markers could be utilized in breeding programs to identify interspecific hybrids. A subset of 23 unique SSRs were found in the non-flowering tetraploid putative Sorghum spp. hybrid, and they may be useful in the characterization of the non-flowering phenotype.

Study design: Cross sectional study Place and Duration of study: South east agro ecological zone of Nigeria, between January 2010- December 2010 Methodology: A multistage randomized sampling procedure was used in selecting 120 wholesalers, 240 retailers age range 35-45 and then 24 markets respectively. Structured questionnaire was used to collect information from the respondents. Information collected bordered on volume and value of sales, cost of transportation and channel of distribution. Data were analyzed using marketing margin and Net-return analyses, Efficiency ratio, Chi square and Duncan multiple range tests. Results: The study showed that sweetpotato marketing is not efficient but lucrative. This is as depicted by the results. Net margins realized were N14,632,N24,100,N24,600 and N28,603 on the wholesalers sector while N3,256,N5728,N5775 and N10,000 were realized on the retailers sector. Efficiency results revealed that none of the states/sectors had efficiency of 100%.The efficiencies range (20-80%). There were significant differences in marketing efficiencies in the markets across the states studied. Conclusion: Lack of infrastructural facilities is the main problem militating against efficient marketing system in the zone under study. It is therefore, recommended that infrastructural facilities should be provided for the marketers to reduce spoilage and distressed sales .This will improve marketing efficiency."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:55:30Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Assessment;"},{"subject":"sweet potato;"},{"subject":"performance;"},{"subject":"marketing;"},{"subject":"efficiency and margin."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-11-17","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-11-17","titles":[{"title":"Assessment Of The Performance Of Sweet Potato Marketing System In South East Agro Ecological Zone, Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8140","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8140","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

This paper therefore addresses the challenges facing the small scale maize farmers in Western Province of Kenya in the agricultural reform era. Two hundred small scale farmers were selected through systematic sampling from Lugari, Bungoma, Mt. Elgon and Busia districts which were purposively selected. In addition one hundred extension staff was selected through systematic sampling. The small scale farmers were interviewed with the help of an interview schedule containing open and closed ended questions. While the extension staff filled a self administered questionnaire containing open and closed ended questions. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results revealed that small scale farmers in Western Province lack awareness of improved agricultural practices and technical knowhow because the extension staff to farmer ratio is high. They also lacked finance, experienced high interest rates on credit facilities and uncertainty of the right seed to use due to flooding of the market by many seed companies."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:55:48Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Challenges;"},{"subject":"small-scale;"},{"subject":"maize;"},{"subject":"farmers;"},{"subject":"Kenya;"},{"subject":"agriculture;"},{"subject":"reform era;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-10-23","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-10-23","titles":[{"title":"Challenges Facing Small Scale Maize Farmers In Western Province Of Kenya In The Agricultural Reform Era"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8141","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8141","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Physiological postharvest deterioration (PPD) of cassava roots is an endogenous and complex process that restricts their storage potential to only a few days after harvest. This physiological phenomenon is one of the main constraints in cassava agriculture with an enormous impact on the cassava market chain. It is estimated that losses due to PPD in cassava production in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Asia reach 10% and 8%, respectively, whereas in Africa they reach 29%. Several years of research have been accumulating evidence to consider PPD as a wounding stress deficient process involving changes in enzymatic activity and oxidative stress. The primary symptoms, the development of dark bluish or brownish radial veins or streaks near xylem vessels of the root pith tissue, appear within 2-3 days after harvest and spread to the neighboring parenchyma tissues producing a more general browning discoloration throughout the root. Secondary post-harvest deterioration, often appears when the roots suffer moderate to severe damage at harvest and is mediated by a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, Several strategies have been proposed to overcome the problem, but each alternative has its limitations due to the variable results, lack of objective and systematic methodology for PPD evaluation, applications not conducive for use at farmer-level, limited genetic variability or absence of genetic and biochemical information.

The present study was aimed at finding out the nature and magnitude of genetic variability in dual-purpose cowpea for leaf yield and quality attributes. Place and Duration of Study: Ngaoundéré University (Cameroon), from 2008 to 2009. Study design and Methodology: Fourteen pure lines and ten F1 hybrids derived from a 5 x 5 half-diallel cross were grown in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications to assess the genetic mechanism of leaf yield index (LYI), leaf area (LA), leaves per plant (NLP), leaf protein (LN) and phosphorus (LP) content. Results: Analysis of variance indicated significant differences (p&lt;0.01) among genotypes for all traits. Moderate to high heritability in broad-sense (0.49-0.90) was recorded for the characters indicating major role of genetic variance in the expression of these polygenic traits. Diallel analysis showed significance (p&lt;0.05) of the effects of general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), the involvement of additive and dominance genes. These genes were asymmetrically distributed among the parental genotypes. Dominant genes had an overall positive effect for leaves per plant, leaf yield index and phosphorus content while high protein content and surface area appeared to be associated mostly with recessive genes. Correlations between the leaf attributes and seed yield components were significant only for leaves per plant and seeds per pod (-0.73), pods per plant (-0.69); leaf yield index and seed weight (0.69); leaf protein content and pods per plant (-0.77). Conclusion: These results could be exploited in breeding programs to develop nutritional superior cowpea varieties which could be used for harvesting of both leaves and seeds."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:57:32Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Vigna unguiculata;"},{"subject":"leaf yield;"},{"subject":"leaf protein and phosphorus;"},{"subject":"diallel analysis;"},{"subject":"genetic improvement;"},{"subject":"Guinea savannah zone."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-10-07","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-10-07","titles":[{"title":"Genetic Architecture Of Some Leaf Yield And Quality Attributes In Dual-Purpose Cowpea (Vigna Unguiculata L.

The aim of the comparative study was to assess the performance of breeding lines developed for various ecosystems and to identify stable genotypes with wide adaptability. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used in each location. Combined analysis of variance revealed highly significant effects of locations, seasons, genotypes and their interactions for most of the studied traits. All the genotypes gave high grain yield which ranged from 2.17 to 4.03 t ha-1 under irrigated conditions. Simple and combined analyses of variance indicated that genotypes differed significantly in grain yield, NERICA 4, NERICA 14, NERICA 15, YUNLU 33 and WAB-1-38-19-14-P2-HB were higher yielding genotypes giving 3.78, 4.03, 3.24, 3.55 and 3.51 t ha-1 respectively.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Mkindo (improved traditional) in Mvomero district, and Mwega (Modern) and Chabi (Traditional) in Kilosa District, between March and April 2010. Methodology: In each scheme we used 40 farmers practicing irrigation rice farming. Between-scheme differences for infected farmers were tested using one way-ANOVA, and t-test for differences between infected and non-infected farmers within and irrespective of schemes. Results: Over 60% of all farmers surveyed reported to have had suffered from schistosomiasis, with traditional scheme exhibiting the highest number. Differences in financial expenditures on treatment and care were detected between improved traditional and traditional (P&lt;0.001), and improved traditional and modern (p=0.014). Similarly, hours spent on treatment and care differed between improved traditional and traditional (p=0.001) and between traditional and modern (p=0.028). Additionally, net working hours per month differed between traditional and improved traditional (p=0.002) and between traditional and modern (p=0.056). Contrary, only net working hours per month differed between infected and non-infected farmers within traditional (p=0.003) and modern (p=0.001) before and after converting hours spent on caring of oneself/other family members into monetary cost. The same variable exhibited significant difference all schemes pooled together (p&lt;0.001). Results of this study contravene the hypothesis that farmers in the modern scheme would have high income balance compared to farmers in traditional and improved traditional. Conclusion: Four key conclusions were reached: 1) Contrary to our expectation, net income balance remained highest in the improved traditional scheme both before and after conversion of time spent on treatment and care into monetary cost, but remained smallest amount in the traditional scheme. 2) Failure of expenditures related to treatment and care to trigger significant difference in net income balance between infected and non-infected farmers, both between and within schemes caused the proposed hypothesis not to be accepted. 3) Apparently, the family that replaces the labour of a family that fails to indulge in production process due to schistosomiasis illness is likely to undergo an economic cost as they will have abandoned their own production activities. But then, the tendency of ignoring such cost is deep rooted in many African traditions including rice farmers in Morogoro schemes thus causing underestimation of the actual Socio-economic cost of schistosomiasis in Sub-Sahara Africa. 4) Occurrence of higher expenditures on treatment and care in traditional than in modern and improved traditional schemes justify the need for improvement of traditional irrigation infrastructures and cleanliness as well as training on water management and cropping calendar that would “cut” the pathways of schistosomiasis transmission."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:58:49Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Irrigated agriculture;"},{"subject":"schistosomiasis;"},{"subject":"socio-economic effects;"},{"subject":"Morogoro;"},{"subject":"Tanzania."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-05-08","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-05-08","titles":[{"title":"Socio-Economic Effects Of Schistosomiasis On Irrigation Rice Growers In Morogoro, Tanzania"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8151","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:23Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8151","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Descriptive statistics, cost benefit analysis and stochastic frontier production function were used for analyzing the data. It was revealed from the findings that mean benefit cost ratio for pig production was 2.82, this means that the enterprise is profitable. The result of the Cobb- Douglass stochastic production frontier function also showed that stocking cost, cost of feed and cost of labour had positive significant effects on the production output, the estimated gamma parameter (γ) was 0.780 and highly significant at 99% (0.01). Sex, age and household size had negative significant effects on economic inefficiency. The sum of elasticity was 1.191, indicating a positive increasing return to scale in the study area which might lead to over utilization of inputs in terms of excess spending on inputs.

Study Design: Field survey. Place and Duration of Study: Southern Guinea savanna of Adamawa State, Nigeria, between 1995 and 2010. Methodology: The respondents interviewed were selected using a simple random sampling and purposive sampling techniques proportional to the size of the areas studied. A sample of 120 respondents formed the sample size. Data were collected from hunters, farmers, herdsmen, foresters and civil servants in the study area. At the end of data collection only 100 questionnaires were correctly filled and returned. The remaining 20 were rejected owing to inconsistencies in their responses. Descriptive statistical analyses such as frequency and percentage were used to analyze the data obtained using statistical package for social science (SPSS 13). Results: The results obtained show that 96% of the respondents interviewed were males and 4% females. Most of them were aged between 31 to 40 years with 45% representing active part of the population. 30% of the respondents engaged in farming, 21% hunting, 20% pastoralists, 16% foresters and 13% civil servants. Almost all the respondents agreed that they practice bush burning in order to derive various benefits that include; 24% as a means of land clearing and 18% on maintenance of soil productivity. 23% were on the view that it promotes rapid growth of succulent vegetation for livestock. 18% said that it helps them in their hunting expedition and 14% looked at it as a means of conserving the natural vegetation. At the same time 27% of the respondents maintained that this practice leads to lack of pasture for livestock, 22% pointed out that it leads to destruction of wildlife habitat, others, 18% observed that it brings about reduction in soil fertility, promotes soil erosion and also destroys soil micro-organisms. An overwhelming view was that due to this practice, the climate was getting drier. 27% of the respondents attributed the dryness to a reduction in the amount of rainfall, 24% observed that there was decrease in vegetation cover, 20% maintained that there is increase in hammattan dust and others, 16% and 13% said there has been drying of water bodies and poor harvest. A pressing issue is how to support people to use the soils, the biota and other natural resources without destroying those resources, and without affecting the climate adversely."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:59:41Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Bushfire;"},{"subject":"climate;"},{"subject":"vulnerability;"},{"subject":"environment;"},{"subject":"pollution."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-04-18","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-04-18","titles":[{"title":"Evaluation Of Environmental And Vulnerability Impact Of Bush Burning In Southern Guinea Savanna Of Adamawa State, Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8154","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:24Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8154","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

This research focused on computing the correlation coefficients and path coefficients of yield and its contributing traits in pigeon pea landraces Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. Methods: Seeds of two varieties of locally grown pigeon pea were sown in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in ten replications. The field study was done at the University of Calabar Experimental Farm, University of Calabar, Calabar, South-South, Nigeria, during the 2009-2010 growing season. Correlation coefficients and path coefficients (partitioned into direct and indirect effects) were estimated on yield and its contributing traits. Results: Correlation results revealed that there was significant positive correlations between plant height plant-1 and number of leaves plant-1 (0.926**), leaf area plant-1 (0.574*) and number of seeds plant-1 (0.616*). It also showed that the number of leaves plant-1 was positively correlated with the pod length plant-1 (0.589*) and number of seeds plant-1 (0.682*). Leaf area plant-1 had a positive significant association with the number of seeds plant-1 (0.581*). Additionally, pod length plant-1 correlated positively with the number of seed plant-1 (0.850**) while number of nodules plant-1 correlated positively with 100- seed weight (0.804**). Path coefficient results showed that 100-seed weight had the highest direct effect on yield (0.583), which was positive. This was followed by the pod length plant-1 (0.519), number of leaves (0.452), and leaf area (0.252) while plant height plant-1 had negative direct effect but very high (-0.633). Number of pod plant-1 had the lowest direct effect on yield (0.033). Additionally, genotypic correlation coefficient with yield showed very high coefficients, especially for pod length plant-1 (0.827), 100-seed weight (0.798), number of leaves plant-1 (0.644), plant height plant-1 (0.582) and leaf area plant-1 (0.549), respectively. Number of nodules plant-1 had the lowest genotypic correlation coefficient (0.042) followed by number of flowers plant-1 (-0.063). Conclusion: The two results from correlation and path coefficient analyses strongly suggest that plant height plant-1, number of leaves plant-1, leaf area plant-1 and pod length plant-1 and 100- seed weight should be considered as indices for selecting high yielding pigeon pea genotypes, especially the landraces."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T12:59:58Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Correlation;"},{"subject":"path coefficient;"},{"subject":"Pigeon pea landraces;"},{"subject":"selection."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-04-12","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-04-12","titles":[{"title":"Correlation And Path Coefficient Analyses Of Seed Yield And Its Contributing Traits In Cajanus Cajan (L.)

Results: Our results revealed that the proximate, anti-nutritive factors and amino acid profile were significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced with increasing gamma irradiation dose. Though percentage germination was not significantly (P&gt;0.05) affected, there was delayed germination and survival percentage became zero percent on exposure to 400Gy and above. “Olaudi” variety was less affected by the gamma rays exposure going by the result of the days to seedling emergence and percentage survival, making pigeon pea species more sensitive to the irradiation.

Methodology: The analysis employs cross-section county-level data to test the null hypothesis of no significant relationship between agricultural and non-agricultural employment growth in Alabama. The hypothesis is tested using instrumental variables approach. Results: The key findings suggest that growth of the rural agricultural employment sector positively influences growth in the non-agricultural employment sector. The average multiplier was estimated at 1.10 percent, implying that one percent growth of the rural agricultural sector induces 1.10 percent growth of the non-agricultural sector in Alabama.

Tamcot Sphinx was statistically greater than all other cultivars in root dry matter, while the statistical least amount of cotyledon dry matter was produced in the 15/20°C temperature regime. The highest lateral root length, lateral root numbers, and root branch intensity were produced at 15/35°C. Tamcot Sphinx was numerically higher than all other cultivars in mean taproot length and total lateral root number over all temperature regimes. In the cool temperature regime of 15/20°C, Stoneville 4892BR had the greatest taproot length, showing tolerance for cooler temperatures.

Also, the factors affecting loan size were analyzed. In carrying out this cross-sectional study, data were collected with stratified sampling technique, using structured and pre-tested questionnaires from 100 loan beneficiaries and five financial institutions in the zone. The study lasted for a period of six months, effective April, 2010. Expect value method was used to determine their optimum loan requirement while OLS multiple regression analysis technique was employed in determining factors affecting loan size of beneficiaries. Results showed that the potent factors affecting loan size were farm size, level of education, enterprise type, farmers experience and dependency ratio. The result further indicated that the respondents were highly limited by capital as the financial institutions met only 60% of their capital needs. The optimum loan requirement determined for the farmers were N292, 315, and N435, 753 for Cassava and Yam farmers respectively, for farm size of 0.80 hectare. For poultry farmers of about 120 birds, the optimum loan requirement estimated was N492, 500.

Percentage germination, percentage survival (field condition), seedling height and tiller production were the traits measured on the M1 generation. The results indicated that increasing doses of gamma irradiation had no effect on germination for the first seven days under laboratory conditions. Percentage survival of germinated seedlings from the 8th to 14th day under laboratory conditions decreased significantly with increase in radiation dose up to 600 Gy. With increase in radiation above 300 Gy a reduction in seedling height and percentage survival under field conditions was observed in irradiated plants of M1 generation. Increase in gamma ray doses from 50 to 300 Gy had little or no effect on tiller production as there were no significant differences in tiller number of irradiated seeds and non-irradiated (control) for all the varieties evaluated. The LD50 values determined from regression analysis based on percentage field survival ranged from 345 Gy for ROK18 to 423 Gy for ROK22.

Study design: Randomized complete block design with four replicates. Place and Duration of Study: Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana Substation at Bunso, between June 1998 and March 2011. Methodology: Plantain, cassava and maize were planted alone or as mixtures to give the following intercrop combinations: sole crop cocoa, cocoa/plantain, cocoa/cassava, cocoa/maize, cocoa/cassava/plantain, cocoa/cassava/maize, cocoa/plantain/maize and cocoa/plantain/cassava/maize. The girth and height of cocoa seedling, the yield of the food crops and cocoa, some physic-chemical properties of the soil and the profitability of the various combinations were assessed using analysis of variance. Percentage canopy development of cocoa under the various treatments was analyzed after square root transformation of the data. Results: Intercropping significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the girth of cocoa seedlings in the cocoa/plantain combination only in the second year. The height of cocoa plant was not significantly influenced by the treatments. The cocoa/plantain/cassava/maize combination had the lowest but non-significant levels of N, P and K in the soil at the end of three years of food crop intercropping. Between 2001 and 2011, although the amount of harvested cocoa was not significantly affected by the treatments, cocoa beans from the intercrops was 28-60% more than the sole crop cocoa except in the case of the cocoa/cassava combination where there was a slight decrease in yield. Economic analysis of the treatments showed that intercropping was profitable. Higher net benefits were achieved where the combinations contained plantain and maize. Conclusion: Intercropping cocoa with food crops is beneficial since it generally increased cocoa bean yield and income even in the absence of fertilizer application.

Study design: 9 sugar beet O-type lines were crossed as a 9×9 4 Diallel crossing scheme using Griffing's method II and along with four control treatments were assessed in a triple lattice design with three replicates. Place and Duration of Study: Safiabad Agricultural Research Center, Dezful, Iran during 2008-2009 growing season. Methodology: Analysis of combining ability by using Griffing's method II Diallel crossing scheme after elimination of the control treatments. KWS scale from 1 to 9 (1= healthy plants and 9 = maximum injury) was used to estimate the resistance to Cercospora disease. Results: General combining ability of O-types was significant for potassium, alpha-amino nitrogen and alkalinity at 1% and for resistance to Bolting and Cercospora, molassed sugar, root yield, sugar yield and white sugar yield at 5% probability levels. Also, specific combining ability was significant for resistance to Bolting, potassium, root yield and sugar yield at 1% and for resistance to Cercospora and white sugar yield at 5% probability levels. Conclusion: Additive and non-additive gene effects control the expression of resistance to Cercospora and white sugar yield.

The escalating cost of dietary protein ingredients necessitates the search for alternatives in poultry production. The inclusion of crayfish waste (CW) and poultry offal (PO) in chicken feeds could reduce the cost of dietary proteins. The study evaluated the utilisation of CW and PO as dietary protein sources for chicken production. Study Design: One hundred and eighty day-old Marshall broiler chicks were used for the study in a completely randomized design. Proximate composition of the poultry offal meal and crayfish waste was determined using the analytical methods of AOAC (1996). Data generated were subjected to analysis of variance and significant treatment means were separated using Duncan Multiple Range Test. Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out in the Poultry Section of the Teaching and Research Farm of the Lagos State Polytechnic, Ikorodu. The study lasted for nine weeks (five weeks for the starter period and four weeks for the finisher period). Methodology: One hundred and eighty day-old Marshall broiler chicks were used for the study. Thirty chicks were assigned to each dietary treatment, which was replicated three times in a completely randomized design. Six experimental diets containing fish meal (FM), crayfish waste meal (CWM) and poultry offal meal (POM) were used thus: control diet which was diet 1 contained 2.1% FM of the total ingredients, while diets 2,3,4,5 and 6 contained 2.79% POM, 3.92%CWM, 2.09% POM + 0.98%CWM, 1.40% POM + 1.96% CWM, and 0.69% POM + 2.94%CWM, respectively. Birds were fed the starter diets for five weeks after which the finisher diets were fed for four weeks. Results: The CWM contained 35.0, 12.9 and 3.9% CP, CF, and EE, respectively and 1454Kcal/kg ME, while the POM contained 51.9, 1.8 and 6.2% CP, CF and EE correspondingly with 2600Kcal/kg ME. However, FM contained 65.1, 0.8 and 6.0% CP, CF and EE with corresponding ME of 2860Kcal/kg. The control birds (diet 1) and diet 6 consumed 2.98kg similar to diets 2 (2.97kg) but differed significantly (P =0.05) from those on diets 3, 4, and 5. The protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were similar for all treatments. Chicken fed diet 3 had an eviscerated weight of 84.27% which was significantly (P=.05) better than others.

Methodology: The eight (8) treatments consist of three rates of Fluazifop (0.15, 0.22 and 0.30 kilogram active ingredient per hectare (kg a.i./ha) and three rates of Propanil (0.72, 1.44 and 2.16 kg a.i./ha), hoe-weeded at 3 weeks after planting (WAP) and a weedy check. The sesame seeds (variety “E8”) used for trials was planted by broadcasting on plot sizes of 5m×4m (20m2). The herbicide applications were carried out as post-emergence at 15 days after planting. Fertilizer NPK (20:10:10) was applied at 4 WAP at the rate of 150 kg ha-1 by broadcasting. Results: The three rates of Fluazifop significantly controlled grasses without any crop injury. However, Propanil controlled both grasses and sedges, but on broadleaf weeds, the effect increased with increasing at 4 WAP. Grain yield was highest (858 kg ha-1) at 0.72 kg a.i./ha of Propanil, that was followed by treatments that received 1.44kg a.i./ha of the same herbicide. The least grain yield (467 kg ha-1) was obtained with the weedy check. Conclusion: The highest benefit-cost ratio of 3.53 was obtained from Propanil at rate of 0.72kg a.i./ha.

The study made use of a crosssectional data obtained from sampled soybean farmers in the Ogo-Oluwa of Ogbomoso zone of Oyo State Agricultural Development Project (ADP) that were purposively selected because of the higher concentration of soybean farms compared to other LGAs in the zone. Eighty respondents were randomly chosen from a list of soybean farmers obtained from the Apex Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN). Data collected was analysed using the stochastic frontier model. The overall technical efficiency was estimated with no effort of broken it down into pure and scale efficiencies. It was observed from the findings that the range of efficiencies index varies great with minimum of 0.827, 0.135 and 0.128 and maximum of 1.0 for technical allocative and economic efficiencies respectively. The mean efficiency which indicate the average potential there in soybean production in the study area 0.94, 0.892 and 0.839 for technical, allocative and economic efficiency respectively. Of 80 soybean farmers involved in the analysis only one was found to be technically allocatively and economically efficient. The measures of relative allocative and technical efficiency provide evidence as to the source of deviations from overall cost-minimising behaviour. Many sampled soybean farms employed the ‘wrong’ input mix, given input prices, so that, on average, costs were 11 per cent higher than the cost minimizing level. However, farms have the potential to reduce their physical input, on average, by 6 per cent, and still produce the same level of soybean output. In conclusion, there was a great potential to improve the output of soybean farms and save cost if variable inputs were adjusted to the optimal level along the short-run isoquant. Farmer’s age, extension visit and education significantly influence technical, economic and allocative efficiencies respectively. Inefficiency results in large part from allocative rather than from technical inefficiency."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:04:59Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Soybean;"},{"subject":"DEA;"},{"subject":"economic efficiency;"},{"subject":"Tobit."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-11-17","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-11-17","titles":[{"title":"Economic Efficiency Of Soybean Production In Ogo-Oluwa Local Government Area Of Oyo State, Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8172","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:26Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8172","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Field experiments were conducted in four representative low and high elevation communities in the semi-arid Central Andean Region of Bolivia from 2006 to 2009. Treatments included a control, and applications of sheep and cow manure, a commercial household/urban compost product, a commercial biofertilizer soil amendment, urea and diammonium phosphate and combinations of these different treatments. Soil samples were taken from all the sites prior to application of treatments and planting of potatoes as well as during the growing season and prior to planting of a subsequent crop of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa, Willd). Soil pH, soil total organic C, and total N increased due to application of organic fertilizers with or without inorganic fertilizers. Soil inorganic N and Bray-1 P were increased by inorganic fertilizers alone or when combined with organic fertilizers. The residual effect of most of the analyzed soil nutrients was detected in the subsequent growing season. In addition, lower soil bulk density was observed after organic fertilizers were applied with or without inorganic fertilizers and this residual effect persisted for the quinoa crop. In a controlled laboratory incubation experiment, soil potentially mineralizable C and N increased as organic fertilizers application rates rose from 0 to 30 Mg ha-1.

The results showed significantly reduction in weed population with herbicides application (P=.05). Percentage reductions over control ranged from 65 to 91 percent in 2009 and from 68 to 87 percent in 2010. The herbicides Stam (PE), RiceForce (Pe) and ButaForce (Pe) were the most effective in reducing weed population (P=.05). All herbicides treatments gave significantly higher grain yields than control plots. Grain yields increased with increased rates of application but yields from full and three-quarter doses were similar. Yields of the two varieties at Rokupr were similar to Gbomsamba. The threequarter doses for the herbicides RiceForce (Pe) and ButaForce (Pe) could be considered for higher marginal returns.

This experiment set to evaluate the usefulness of SSR markers to determine genetic purity of commercial hybrids and their inbred lines. Place and Duration of Study: Bioscience unit, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria in December, 2011 Methodology: Seedlings of four F1 hybrids and four inbred lines were grown in the screen house of IITA for DNA extraction using Dellaporta method with some modifications. Six Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers were used for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using Touch-Down PCR profile. The analysis is by fragment analysis as present (1) or absent (0) Mathematical equation to determine genetic purity of the genotypes was developed from the genetic distances matrix. Results: Simple descriptive analysis revealed that average genetic diversity and polymorphism information content (PIC) recorded by the markers was 0.592 and 0.512 respectively. Genetic purity level of inbred lines ranged between 91.3% and 98.7% while the hybrids ranged between 81.3% and 95%. Conclusion: SSR markers are powerful biotechnological tool capable of detecting genetic purity status of Nigerian maize hybrids therefore inclusion of DNA analysis of seeds using SSR markers to determine genetic purity of maize seed is recommended. However, further research work with larger number of seed samples per variety will be needed to validate reliability."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:06:27Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Maize;"},{"subject":"genetic purity;"},{"subject":"DNA analysis;"},{"subject":"SSR markers."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-08-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-08-28","titles":[{"title":"Application Of Ssr Markers For Genetic Purity Analysis Of Parental Inbred Lines And Some Commercial Hybrid Maize (Zea Mays L.)"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8177","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:27Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8177","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The remaining phenotypes (black with white marking, brown, black, spotted black, spotted brown, black and brown, brown with white marking and Swiss marking) reflected the presence of eumelanin pigment governed by Aa recessive allele. Based on the two pigment types, 71.58% and 28.42% of sheep had coat colour predominated by phaeomelanin and eumelanin pigments, respectively. Result of chi square (X2) analysis showed that the difference between observed and expected frequencies was significant (P=.05) implying that there was a deviation from the expected 3:1 Mendelian ratio.

Place and Duration of Study: Teaching and Research Farm of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi in Benue State, located in the Southern Guinea Savanna of Nigeria from June-November of 2010 and 2011. Materials and Methods: The treatments comprised of eleven sweet potato varieties [CIP 440141, K134, NASPOT4, NASPOT2, SPK004, TIS87/0087(check), CIP440037, 1900411, NARSP/05/007C, CIP440293 (orange skin and flesh) and NARSP/05/022 (orange flesh)] set out in randomized complete block design with three replications. Ten farmers were used for the preference test of the varieties. Results: Some vegetative growth parameters evaluated in the study (number of branches/plant, internodes length, number of leaves per plant and vine length) increased at different rates between 4 - 16 weeks after planting. Root diameter and length, number of saleable roots and weight varied with the varieties of sweet potato in Makurdi. NARSP/05/022 gave the highest number of leaves, number of roots (121817/ha) and weight (54151 kg/ha) at harvest, although it also had the highest incidence of sweet potato weevil infestation. This variety was the only one that had significantly higher saleable root weight than the check (TIS 87/0087). Saleable root weight correlated positively and significantly with number of saleable roots and root diameter.

Most studies on the impact of disease on a crop pertain to the extent of yield reductions caused, and not to perturbation or annihilation of the production rhythm. On the Crittenden Farm of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY, field trials were conducted to study the impact of cucurbit viruses Zucchini yellow mosaic (ZYMV) and Watermelon mosaic (WMV) on production rhythms of transgenic ZW- 20 (H and B) and nontransgenic cv Pavo squash. Both, ZW-20H and ZW-20B were genetically engineered from cv Pavo and expressed virus-resistance evoked by coat protein genes of ZYMV and WMV. The nontransgenic cv. Pavo control did not contain virus resistance and was fully susceptible to ZYMV and WMV. Production rhythms were depicted by time series of successive average numbers of small fruits of marketable size, harvested at 2-3 day intervals between 31 and 49 days post planting (dpp). For both, virus-infected and virus-free transgenic ZW-20 ( H and B ), as well as for virusfree nontransgenic cv Pavo the trend was manifest that, at each harvest the number of fruits was higher than at the previous one; indicating the existence of autocorrelation between harvest rounds of these genotypes. In contrast, this trend of increasing numbers of fruits could not be identified with virus-infected nontransgenic cv Pavo. Consistent with these trends, Von Neumann’s Q confirmed the occurrence of significant autocorrelations between harvest rounds of ZW-20 (both, virusfree and infected) and of virus free nontransgenic cv Pavo. In contrast, Von Neumann’s Q did not detect autocorrelation between harvest rounds of virus-infected nontransgenic cv Pavo. These results reveal that autocorrelation between harvest rounds was retained in transgenic ZW-20 squash, irrespective if they were virus-infected or not, but was lost in infected virus-susceptible nontransgenic cv Pavo crops. The outcomes of this study sustain the hypothesis that ZYMV and WMV have no impact on the production rhythms of virus-resistant transgenic ZW-20 squash, but they do alter those of nontransgenic cv Pavo."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:07:56Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Phenotypic plasticity;"},{"subject":"fruit removal;"},{"subject":"autocorrelation;"},{"subject":"von Neumann."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-07-11","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-07-11","titles":[{"title":"On The Impact Of Zucchini Yellow And Watermelon Mosaic Viruses On The Production Rhythms Of Transgenic Zw-20 And Nontransgenic Squash (Cucurbita Pepo L.)"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8182","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:27Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8182","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Cross-sectional data. Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out from March 1 to 30, 2011 in five districts from the Central Region of Ghana which is basically agrarian. Methodology: A multistage randomized sampling method was used in selecting 300 business women from the five districts: Agona West Municipality; Cape Coast Metropolis; Efutu Municipality; Mfantsiman Municipality and Upper Denkyira East District. Structured questionnaire and interview schedule were used to elicit information from the respondents. Information sought bordered on business income, the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents and other factors that influence participation in microcredit. Analysis of data was carried out using propensity score matching (PSM) approach. Results: Results revealed that number of years in formal education, satisfaction of application procedures, membership to business associations, amount of savings with financial institutions, and the satisfaction of interest charges are factors that positively influence women’s likelihood of participating in microcredit programmes. The PSM results showed that women operating small businesses with microcredit had statistically significant higher income compared with their non-microcredit participating counterpart. Conclusion: It is, therefore, concluded that formal schooling, satisfaction with lending procedures and interest as well as amount of money saved with the micro finance institution influence their participation in the micro credit programme. Also microcredit provides a means for increasing income of women in small scale businesses. Based on the PSM results women in small businesses should be encouraged to participate in microcredit as it significantly increases their income levels."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:08:32Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Microcredit;"},{"subject":"small businesses;"},{"subject":"propensity score matching;"},{"subject":"counterfactual;"},{"subject":"Logit."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-06-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-06-28","titles":[{"title":"Women Participation In Microcredit And Its Impact On Income: A Study Of Small-Scale Businesses In The Central Region Of Ghana"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8184","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:28Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8184","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Data were collected from 60 farmers using a face–to–face questionnaire method. The majority of farmers in the surveyed region were growing cucumber and tomato. The results revealed that cucumber production was the most energy intensive rather than tomato production. Cucumber production consumed a total of 124.44 G J ha–1 followed by tomato with 116.76 G J ha–1. The energy ratio (energy use efficiency) for greenhouse tomato and cucumber were estimated to be 0.92 and 0.56 respectively. This indicated an intensive use of inputs in greenhouse vegetable production not accompanied by increase in the final product. Econometric model evaluation showed the impact of human power for both tomato and cucumber production was significant at 1% levels and had the highest impact among the other inputs in greenhouse tomato and cucumber production. Economic analysis indicated that the total costs of production for one hectare of tomato and cucumber production were around 34939 and 31956$, respectively. Accordingly, the benefit–cost ratio for these productions was 2.74 and 1.79, respectively. The total amounts of CO2 for tomato and cucumber production were calculated as 4.622 and 4.930 tons ha–1 respectively, which indicated the high CO2 output in both cultivations.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of diets containing different amount of Wheat dried distillers' grain as a partial substitute for alfalfa hay on lactation performance, blood metabolites and chewing activity of lactating Holstein dairy cows. Nine primiparous Holstein lactating dairy cows (76±18 days in milk) were assigned randomly to a replicated 3×3 Latin square design with 21 d periods. Basal diet (BD) was provided using 31.2% alfalfa hay, 15.6% corn silage, 12.5% barley grain, 12.5% corn grain, 8.6% cottonseed, 7.1% wheat bran, 10.5% soybean meal and 2% premix on dry matter basis. Alfalfa hay and soybean meal was partially substituted with WDDG as 5% (BD+WDDG5) and 8.7% (BD+WDDG8.7). Experimental diets were calculated to achieve same amount of CP and metabolizable energy. Throughout the experiment, cows were housed in tie-stalls barn and fed ad libitum a total mixed ration twice daily at 008 and 1800 h. Dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield was recorded daily. Milk samples were collected weekly at each milking, then, analyzed for protein, lactose and fat. Blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein into heparinized evacuated tubes on the last day of each experimental period at 4 h post-feeding, then, plasma was provided. Plasma samples were analyzed to determine glucose and urea-N concentrations. Chewing activity (i.e. eating, ruminating, idle)for cows were monitored over a 24 h by manually observing individual cows every 5 min. Inclusion of WDDG in the experimental diets did not affect DMI, milk yield, milk composition, blood glucose. Except for total chewing activity (min/kg NDF) that was decreased significantly with inclusion of WDDG, all other evaluating indices were not affected by treatments. However, diet containing WDDG at 5% caused a significant decrease (P&lt;0.05) in blood plasma urea-N compared with that of the cows fed basal diet (BD= 21.6 and BD+WDDG5= 19.9 mg/dl).

The experimental design was 6 x 2 factorial arranged in randomized complete block design (RCBD) in three replications. Six rice varieties and two systems (weed-free and in competition) were evaluated. The results showed varietal differences in their competitiveness against weeds. Average yield losses ranged from 13 to 67 percent in 2009 and 12 to 70 percent in 2010. With the exception of plant height, leaf area index (LAI) and tiller number correlated positively with competitiveness. The varieties NERICA L19, NERICA L20 and WAS 57-B-B-17-3-3-6-TGR20 an Inter-specific were found to be good competitors and high yielding, whilst Buttercup (the local variety) though competitive was low yielding. The varieties, NERICA L38 and ROK10 were the worse competitors but yielded similarly as NERICA L19 and NERICA L20 under weed-free plots.

Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out in March 2009 within two agro ecological zones of Osun state, south western Nigeria. Methodology: A field survey of 33 farmers’ fields in two agro ecological zones of Osun state namely; Iwo zone and Oshogbo zone was undertaken. Representative soil samples (0-20cm) were obtained from each field. Physical and chemical properties of soil samples were determined in the laboratory following established methods. Statistical analyses of soil data was carried out using appropriate techniques. Results: The soils of the area are acidic (pH in water range: 5.4 -6.4) and 79% of the fields are deficient in soil organic matter. Nitrogen and phosphorus are below established critical limits for cassava production in half of the fields; exchangeable cations (calcium, magnesium and potassium) are present in adequate amounts in most soils. No significant differences (P .05) were observed between the zones for soil properties measured. Conclusion: Farmer acceptable strategies for improving nutrients availability (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), organic matter and overall soil health through use of fertilizers, organic materials and multipurpose legumes among other options are required for sustained cassava production."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:12:59Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Nitrogen;"},{"subject":"phosphorus;"},{"subject":"Mehlich soil test;"},{"subject":"micro nutrients;"},{"subject":"fertilizer;"},{"subject":"organic material."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-02-02","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-02-02","titles":[{"title":"Soil Fertility Status Of Cassava Fields In South Western Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8199","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:30Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8199","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Studies were conducted at two locations in Southwest Missouri on a longterm forage fertility plot site and three 1 to 1.5 ha sites within beef cattle pasture fields, all having received long-term poultry litter applications. For the long-term plot site, both the direct contact ECa sensor deep reading and the EM-38 (Geonics) sensor in the shallow mode had significant positive correlations with soil test Bray-1 P at both the 0 to 5 and 5 to 15 cm sampling depths. Significant spatial variation in soluble, soil test Bray-1 and total P were observed by landscape position within pasture fields. In general, soil ECa was not significantly correlated with soluble, soil test Bray-1 and total P at each individual pasture site, but when data was combined over all three sites, significant relationships were observed between ECa measured by the EM-38 sensor and soil soluble P, soil test Bray-1 P and total P, especially when the vertical (deep) mode was used. The difference in performance of the two sensors between the two studies was attributed to the proportion of coarse fragments contained in the soils and soil water content. These results suggest that soil ECa measurements may provide some useful information for evaluating spatial variation in soil P due to manure applications. However, further research is needed to assess the processes and factors affecting this relationship before it can be recommended for use for improved soil P management in individual farm fields with varying environmental conditions and management practices."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:13:33Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Soil apparent electrical conductivity;"},{"subject":"poultry litter;"},{"subject":"phosphorus;"},{"subject":"pasture."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-12-22","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-12-22","titles":[{"title":"Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity Used To Determine Soil Phosphorus Variability In Poultry Litter-Amended Pastures"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8201","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:30Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8201","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: At the Research Farm of Zonal Adaptive Research Station Krishnagar, Nadia, West Bengal, India during the kharif season of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Methodology: The experiment was set out in a randomized complete-block design with two replications to determine the nature and magnitude of the variability among the genetic materials, and the intensity of relationships among the traits using multivariate tools. Results: The study analyzed the diversity of phenotypic traits of the landraces of rice. The analysis of variance found significant variability in eighteen quantitative traits used in distance analysis. All the traits except ligule length, culm length, number of grains panicle-1 and number of primary branches panicle-1 exhibited positive and significant correlation coefficients with kernel weight. Leaf length was positively and significantly correlated with leaf breadth (r=0.760), plant height (r=0.309) culm length (r=0.352); plant height showed similar associationship with flag leaf angle (r = 0.337), culm diameter (r=0.688), culm number (r=0.706) and panicle length(r=0.654). Principal component analysis revealed that six quantitative characters viz., leaf length, culm number, culm diameter, number of grains panicle-1, grain length/breadth ratio and grain length significantly influenced the variation in these cultivars. Cluster analysis permitted the separation of landraces into ten major clusters from diverse geographical location, suggesting environmental adaptation of the landraces.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that there were two principal components accounting for 88% of the total variation in the tested breeding material. The new components were named “Vigor”, and “Quality”. Principal Component Regression (PCR) indicated that these two accounted for 93.64% and 7.36% of variation in the yield, thus signifying the role of the “Vigor” Component. Cluster analysis using Ward’s method on the newly created variables using principal components revealed that there were 3 clusters at a linkage distance of 4.5.

Cluster I showed high mean values for Vigor Component while Cluster II for Quality Component and Cluster III showed genotypes with high mean yield. There was no correspondence of the clustering with the geographic location of the genotypes.

Study Design: Random sampling of Tomatoes, from selected sources in Ondo State, Nigeria. Place and Duration of Study: Sample: Akungba-Akoko and some communities in Ondo State. Analysis at Microbiology Laboratory, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko. August, 2011 to July, 2012. Methodology: Pour plate techniques were used to enumerate microbial load of the samples. Discrete isolated colonies from these sources were sub-cultured using streak plate method to get purified cultures for the study. The bacterial isolates were Gram stained while fungal species were examined using lactophenol cotton blue stain. Standard microbiological methods were subsequently used to identify the tomatoes microflora. Result: The bacterial load observed during the study ranged from 1 x 105 in CT3 to 38 x 105 in CT2 which are the canned sample sources. Similar range of 10 to 21 cfu/mL was recorded for the raw tomatoes. Microorganisms generally encountered include eight bacteria species such as, Leuconostoc Species, Pediococcus species, Staphylococcus species, Planococcus species, Micrococcus Species, Bacillus Species, Streptococcus species and Clostridium species. Similarly, three fungal species were encountered during the study. These include Saccharomyces species, Aspergillus species and Neurospora species. Conclusion: The microbial load and isolates from raw (local) tomatoes sources are at close range to those isolated from the canned tomatoes sources which still shows the natural protective lactic acid components of this food source. Exposure of canned tomato to air gives room for deterioration by microorganisms as shown in this study. So, both raw and canned tomato should be well protected from contaminants to limit proliferation of spoilage organisms coupled with improvement of canning Technology.

The study also intended to measure the extent to which cherry yields of Ruiru 11 are affected by the environment. Study Design: Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in three different agro-ecological zones in Kenya namely Mariene in Meru County, Kisii near Kisii town in Kisii county and Koru in Kericho County between November 2008 and September 2011. Methodology: Thirty four (34) Ruiru 11 sibs, all of which are resistant to Coffee Berry Disease and Coffee Leaf Rust, were evaluated in this study alongside two entries of SL28, a cultivar susceptible to the two diseases. One entry of SL28 was sprayed with copper fungicides to control, while the other SL28 entry was not sprayed with any fungicides. Planted at a spacing of 2m by 2m, each entry had 12 trees per plot per rep, giving a total of 1296 plants per experiment per site. Cherry yield recording was done during the peak harvesting period of May to July at Mariene and July to September at Koru and Kisii. The data was subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using XLSTAT version 2012 statistical software and effects declared significant at 5% level. Results: Significant (P = .05) yield differences among Ruiru 11 sibs were obtained in all years of evaluation at Koru but only in 2011 at Kisii and Mariene. There was a greater discrimination between sibs at Koru, followed by Kisii and then Mariene. Year effect was highly significant (P &lt; .001) and equally distinguished in all sites but year x sib interactions were significant (P = .05) only at Kisii. Combined analysis for all environmental combinations showed highly significant (P &lt; .001) differences between sibs, environments and their interaction. Environments made a greater contribution (42.6%) to the variation compared to sibs (7%). The interaction term also made a significant contribution (18.7%). The best sibs per site and those adapted to contrasting environments were identified. Conclusion: The expression of high yield variation among Ruiru 11 sibs is a sign of high potential of intra-selection within the cultivar for yield improvement. Identified sibs can be recommended to farmers and also exploited in future breeding programmes for improvement of Ruiru 11 productivity and agronomic adaptability.

Study Design: Cross sectional. Place and Duration: Kasena-Nankana District of the Upper East Region of Ghana in the 2007/2008 cropping season. Methodology: One-step estimation of the Cobb-Douglas Stochastic Frontier Model. Results: Mean technical efficiency was found to be 0.71, ranging from 0.36 and 0.99. The relatively high efficiency levels were as a result of agricultural intensification measures (such as the adoption of modern inputs) that the farmers followed as well as high levels of education and long years of experience in cultivating tomatoes.

Methodology: The active bud sprouts of vegetative cuttings of RFS135 in multiple sets were treated for twelve hours intermittently (every one hour) with three different concentrations (0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5%).Further M1V1 and M1V2 generation clones were evaluated for biomass, nutritive and morpho-metric characters. Results: The results revealed that concentrations of 0.1% and 0.3% EMS treatment were effective in significantly altering the morpho-metric characters, biomass yield and phyto chemical constituents. The significant variation in the morpho-metric characters such as height of the plant, number of branches, stem girth, number of leaves per plant and increased biomass was recorded among the M1V2 clones of 0.1% EMS treatment (p=0.0001) and 0.3% EMS treatment (p=0.0006). Further significant improvement was recorded in nutritive parameters such as proteins, reducing sugars, minerals and moisture content. Moisture retention capacity and Chlorophyll contents were also found to be high in mutant clones recovered from 0.1% and 0.3% EMS treatments.

Treatment was a combination of water deficit level and GB application with 3 replications. Place and Duration of Study: R.R. Foil Plant Science Research Center, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA between May and July 2010. Methodology: A pot experiment was conducted using 31-d old ‘TV25R19’ maize irrigated with 750 ml pot-1 day-1 (WW: well-watered), 450 mL pot-1day-1 (WD60, 60% of WW) and 300 mL pot-1day-1 (WD40, 40% of WW) grown with or without GB application at each stress level. GB was applied as a foliar spray every 5 days at a rate of 4 kg ha-1. Soil moisture content and leaf water potential, growth, biomass, and gas exchange parameters were measured in response to the treatment variables. Results: Significant GB and water deficit main effects were observed for plant height (PH), leaf dry weight (LDW), ear dry weight (EDW) and total dry weight (TDW) (P  0.05) while GB main effects alone were observed for node number (NN) and stem dry weight (SDW) (P  0.05). GB application increased leaf area (LA) (5,454 cm2 plant-1) in WD60 plants relative to untreated plants. No GB effect was seen under other treatment combinations at 10 or 20 days after treatment (DAT) measurements. GB did not increase stomatal conductance or transpiration at 10 or 20 DAT in plants subjected to water deficit. GB application resulted in leaf water potential values in the WD60 treatment that were statistically similar to the well-watered plants. Volumetric soil water content did not change with foliar GB application across water deficit treatments except under mild stress after 18 DAT, where soil moisture was higher for GB treated plants. Conclusion: GB’s effect was most evident in plants from the WD60 treatment.

Place and Duration: This study was carried out at the Research Farm of the Institute for Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria, during rainy seasons of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Methodology: The treatments consisted of two maize varieties (SAMMAZ 12 and SAMMAZ 27) and five rates of nitrogen (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120kg N ha-1) in the main plots, while three green manure crops (Lablab (Lablab purpureus), Mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) and Soybean (Glycine max (L.)

The green manure crops were incorporated at 49 days (7weeks) after planting. After 3 days of incorporation, maize seeds were planted. Results: SAMMAZ 12 and SAMMAZ 27 were similar on grain yield and most of the yield components studied. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased yield components and grain yield. In combined mean, application of 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg N ha-1 gave 81.4, 127.2, 151.6 and 165.5% increases in maize grain yield over zero N treatment, respectively.

The main objectives of the study were (i) to assess and compare different competition indices and their relationship with yield component under different inorganic and organic fertilizers regimes; and (ii), to identify nutrient management regimes options that lead to high yields and incomes in a maize-soybean intercropping system. Effects of integrated soil practices management on crop competition, yields components and economics advantage in maize-soybean intercropping system in a savannah region of the DR-Congo were investigated. Field trials were conducted at two sites in a randomized complete block design with six treatments replicated four times. Grain yield and yield components increased under integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) (inorganic or mineral and organic fertilization combined) than other treatments at the two sites of the study. Organic biomass application resulted in similar grain yield production than the inorganic (mineral) fertilizer application. The required land decreased when soil was fertilized compared to the control. Land equivalent coefficient (LEC) values ranged from 0.50 to 0.79. Soybean intercropped with maize resulted in an area-time equivalency ratio (ATER) higher than 1 for all the treatments confirming the intrinsic advantage of intercropping over sole crops. Among all the treatments, integrated nutrient management (ISFM) resulted in higher yields and monetary advantage index (MAI) values for maize/soybean mixture compared to other treatments.

The experiments were carried out between the years 2004 to 2009. Methodology: Nutritive potentials of Centrosema pubescens, Mimosa invisa and Pueraria phaseoloides leaf meals (LM) were determined and evaluated using different types of chicken within the years 2004-2009. The diets were formulated to contain 0,20/25, 30/40, 60/75 and 80/90g LM/kg feed and 120 to 150 birds were used in each experiment. Each treatment was replicated three times. All ingredients in each experiment were of constant weight, except the soybean and groundnut cake which test ingredients replaced some percentages weight for weight. Data on feed intake and weight gain were subjected to oneway ANOVA and comparisons were made using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. Results: Results revealed that the LM are rich in crude protein (21.36-23.34%) and ash (4.25 – 9.14%). The most available mineral elements were potassium (0.45-1.85%) and calcium (0.60 – 1.726%). The concentration of tannin was highest in the LM (1.57- 3.35g/100gDM) unlike oxalate (0.037-0.065g/100gDM). The poorest LM in terms of nutritive value and chicken performance was Mimosa invisa leaf meal (MLM), while the best was Centrosema pubescens leaf meal (CLM). Inclusion of 40 – 60gCLM/kg feed for Black Nera chicks and finisher pullets and 75gCLM/kg feed for broiler starters and finishers resulted to significant (P&lt;0.05) reduction in feed intake and weight gain. Feed intake and weight gain of broiler starters and finishers and cockerel growers fed 20 – 60gMLM/kg feed supplements significantly (P&lt;0.05) and progressively decreased with increased dietary concentration of MLM supplement. Broiler starters and finishers fed 30-90PLM/kg feed had increased feed intake, which was progressive, unlike their weight gain which depressed significantly (P&lt;0.05) with increased concentration of Pueraria phaseoloids leaf meal (PLM). Conclusion: Hence, 20 and 25g CLM/kg feed is recommended for pullet chicks/growing pullets and broiler chicken, respectively, while PLM and MLM are not recommended, for chicken nutrition due to depression in growth rate."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:17:38Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Nutritive potential;"},{"subject":"legume leaf meal;"},{"subject":"growth responses;"},{"subject":"chicken."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-03","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-03","titles":[{"title":"Nutritional Potential Of Centrosema Pubescens Mimosa Invisa And Pueraria Phaseoloides Leaf Meals On Growth Performance Responses Of Broiler Chickens"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8215","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:32Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8215","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The forages, which constitute the bulk of the source of feed for these animals, fluctuate in supply with poor nutrient content especially during the dry season of the year. The convectional protein concentrates which boost the protein supply faces intense competition from man. It has become imperative for intensive effort to be made at making the unconventional sources of protein available to the farmers. Neem seed cake/ kernel cake fits as one of the unconventional protein supply in view of the high level of the protein content and balancing of the amino acids. It is capable of offering a big relief to these protein shortages. The neem seed is readily available in the northern part of Nigeria that is the home to the largest of number of ruminants in the country. However, they are not readily acceptable to the animals due its pungent smell and bitterness caused by the bioactive principles present. This paper reviewed availability of neem seed in Nigeria, the antinutritional and other bioactive factors inherent in the cake as well as the methods of processing and removing them. The review also highlighted the nutritional quality of the cake, effect on haematological and biochemical characteristics; and the economics of use of the cake.

Place and Duration of Study: Interviewed farmers in Buea and its environs. Field experiments at the Research Farm of the University of Buea, South Western Cameroon. October 2010 to September 2011. Methodology: Structured questionnaires administered to 110 farmers to document how they managed Dacus punctatifrons on their tomatoes and testing the efficacy of Piper guineense aqueous extract, cultural practices like staking, pruning and farm sanitation against this pest in field studies. Results: Most of the farmers, 58(52.73%) cited Dacus punctatifrons as their main insect pest on tomatoes. All the farmers used conventional insecticides injudiciously to control the insect pests. The synthetic pyrethroid, Cypercal® 50EC was the most popular insecticide used. The numbers of fruits with fruit fly damage signs, and number of adult flies that emerged from plots treated with Piper guineense seed extract were not significantly different from those of plots treated with the neonicotinoid Parastar® 40EC insecticide. These two treatments were significantly superior to the untreated control plots and those where the plants were staked, regularly weeded and judiciously pruned. Fallen fruits and those harvested from farms even up to five weeks after farmers had harvested all marketable fruits still contained Dacus punctatifrons larvae that eventually developed into adults which emerged after laboratory incubation.

Study Design: Cross-sectional study Place and Duration of Study: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the aforementioned irrigation networks in the Khuzestan province between January of 2008 and October of 2009. Methodology: Using the simple random sampling technique, 278 farmers (26, 70 and 128 farmers from the Zohreh-Jarrahi, Maroun and Gotvand irrigation networks respectively) were chosen. This sample comprised of 258 males and 20 females, aged 16-87 years old. The theoretical framework of the present study was based on the key aspects of the health belief model (HBM), later completed by adding a few other effective variables. The data were then analyzed by the multivariable technique, using SPSS software. Results: The findings of this study indicate that the key aspects of the health belief model significantly predict the farmers’ water management behaviors. In other words, understanding the advantages and barriers associated with the preservation of water resources influences the farmers’ water management behaviors through affecting their attitudes. Furthermore, existing attitudes towards water management practices in thereat, understanding the barriers associated with the preservation of water resources, and last but not least, perceived susceptibility against threats to water resources, all directly influence the farmers’ water management behaviors. Access to information regarding advanced water management techniques in the farm is another variable included in the theoretical framework used for this study, playing a key role in predicting the farmers’ management attitudes and behaviors. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates a successful and clear application of the health belief model to water management in the farm using a few other significant variables, while enhancing the HBM for application to other issues related to the preservation of environmental resources.

Place and Duration of Study: Kasungu, Mchinji, Lilongwe and Balaka districts in Malawi Methodology: A structured questionnaire was administered to 118 extension personnel in the study areas. The data were subjected to cross tabulation in SPSS to obtain frequencies of the various study parameters. Results: Of the 118 officers, 36% were aware A. vogelii, compared to 91% that were aware of S. asiatica while Striga forbesii and S. gesneiroides were hardly known (&lt; 2%). Predominant source of information for A. vogelii was meetings (24%), followed by brochures (17%) and college (3%) while the rest were less than 2 %. For S. asiatica the predominant sources were meetings (55 %), brochures (32 %), college (21 %), and radio (16 %). Field days, newspapers, books, internet and projects were seldom sources (&lt; 6%). The control measures known for both species were resistant variety, sanitation, rotation and manure application. Fewer personnel were aware of these as control measures for A. vogelii than against S. asiatica. Generally, supervisory staff were more aware of control measures for both species than frontline staff. Conclusion: Results of this study have shown that little awareness exists on the parasitic weed A. vogelii compared to S. asiatica. The current extension methods involving meetings and brochures are operational at very low rates, while there is much less effort for dissemination with media and field days. Meetings are predominant means of information source, and that information flow between extension personnel in supervisory positions and frontline staff is minimum. Knowledge on control methods is poor, particularly for frontline staff."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:19:28Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Alectra vogelii;"},{"subject":"witchweeds;"},{"subject":"technology transfer extension."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-04-01","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-04-01","titles":[{"title":"Awareness Of The Parasitic Weed Alectra Vogelii (Benth.)

Twenty enterprises were observed in the existing plan made up of one sole crop, fourteen crop mixtures and five livestock enterprises across poultry, fish and piggery which an average farmer would make a gross margin of N232, 317.12. However the LP maximization model recommended that for optimum gross margin of N374, 850.00 which is about 61.35% of the existing gross margin, an average farmer should devote 0.31 hectare to yam/maize/melon, 0.33 hectare to cassava/maize/cocoyam and 1.30 hectares to Cassava/Maize/Yam/Mucuna Floanei while 0.14 of 500 birds of broiler 1 raised usually between January – May and 0.11 of 1000 fish of fish 2 done between July – December and 0.07 of 15 pigs be produced. Given the mean farm size of 0.45 hectares, the farming orientation is still subsistence. It is recommended that crop mixtures be undertaken by farmers in combination with poultry and fish enterprises for improved gross margin.

Study Design: The vibration test simulates a truck operating at highway speed and determines the ability of shipping units to withstand vertical and compression forces resulting from stacking during transport. Storage at 30ºC depicted ambient conditions; 15 and 20ºC are optimum temperatures for ripening; and pink and light-red ripeness depict typical harvest maturity in Ghana. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted at the Postharvest Science Laboratory of the Horticultural Sciences Department of the University of Florida from September to December 2011. Methodology: Round-type tomato at pink and light-red ripeness were subjected to a vibration test and incubated in ripening chambers set at 15, 20 and 30ºC. Critical data was taken on days to red-ripe, CO2, ethylene production, color, firmness, weight loss, pH, titratable acidity and soluble solids content. Results: Overall, the influence of vibration and ripeness on marketable shelf life was marginal; however temperature significantly (P≤0.05) influenced shelf life. Vibration increased weight loss, respiration and ethylene production, which were plummeted at lower temperature. Days to red-ripe indicated that tomato should preferably be marketed by 2-4, 8-12 and 10-15 days at 30, 20 and 15ºC respectively, at pink to light-red ripeness under current distribution conditions. Best chemical properties were maintained at 15 and 20ºC; vibration and ripeness did not influence chemical properties, but increasing temperature affected all physico-chemical properties. Conclusion: The study concludes that despite the cumbersome shipping conditions, tomatoes could be marketed at premium quality if lower storage temperatures were accessible. These facilities are beyond the purchasing power of small-holder traders, thus the involvement of the State and/or Private Sector to providing these facilities would be beneficial; particularly in urban markets where retail prices will merit such investments."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:20:20Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Tomato;"},{"subject":"handling;"},{"subject":"road conditions;"},{"subject":"marketable quality;"},{"subject":"ripening;"},{"subject":"trade policy."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-21","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-21","titles":[{"title":"Improving Marketable Quality Of Tomato: A Simulation Of Shipping Conditions In Ghana"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8224","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:33Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8224","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out in field environment in the nursery of the School of Forestry and Environment, Allahabad Agricultural Institute, Deemed-University, Allahabad, situated at 25.28ºN latitude and 81.55ºE longitude, located at an altitude of 98m amsl, during July, 2010. Materials and Methods: Candidate plus trees of Madhuca indica were marked using the following criteria; Height (m), Diameter at breast height (m), Seed length (cm), Seed diameter (cm), free from disease and insect-pests and straight, non-forked cylindrical bole. Following the above criteria, fresh and fully ripened open pollinated seeds of 20 plus trees were collected from different geographical locations in district Allahabad and adjoining areas in Uttar Pradesh India, during July 2010. Germination tests were conducted under field (open) environment between 30-35ºC. Three replications of 40 seeds each were used for the test. 120 seeds of each plus tree were simultaneously sown under field environment in nursery in polythene bags, in three replicates used RBD design. The germination count was recorded on every alternate day for 30 days. Observations on morphological traits were taken after one growing season. The recorded observations were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to understand the significance of differences among 20 plus tree progenies. Various genetic parameters like genotypic coefficient of variance (GCV), phenotypic coefficient of variance (PCV), broad sense heritability, estimated genetic advance and genetic gain were determined by previously described methods. Results: The results revealed, higher values for phenotype coefficient of variation as compared to genotypic coefficient of variation in corresponding germination and seedling growth characters, indicating that the characters are greatly influenced by the field environment. The heritability and expected genetic gain were also observed to be high to moderate for these characters. There is wide scope for early screening of the genotypes because of the positive and significant correlation at 5% level of significance among germination and seedling growth characters with each other except for few characters times with each other such as internodal length with number of leaves per seedling, number of leaves with dry weight of shoot, fresh weight of root and total biomass of seedling.

The factors consisted of four levels of nitrogen (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha-1) and four different densities (80,000, 100,000, 133,000 and 200,000 plants ha-1). Different statistical analyses such as ANOVA, polynomial regression, correlation, and stepwise multiple linear regression were used. The multiple statistical procedures showed that the main effects of nitrogen rate and plant density levels were significant (P = 0.01) for yield and yield components studied. A rise in nitrogen rate and plant density increased seed and oil yield, whereas plant height, number of branches plant-1, number of heads plant-1, seed yield plant-1 and 1000-seed weight decreased as plant density increased. In general, the highest plant density (200,000 plants ha-1) and the nitrogen level (80 kg ha-1) was the best treatment in this research to attain high safflower seed yield under environmental conditions of Giza Governorate, Egypt. Polynomial models of seed, oil yield and yield components based on the ANOVA were fitted. Polynomial regression analysis indicated that the relationship between the nitrogen amount applied and safflower seed, oil yield and yield components could be defined by using a quadratic function. Also, the results revealed that, yield and yield components were significantly affected by plant density in linear responses. Correlation analysis showed a positive and significant correlation between seed yield ha-1 and each of number of heads plant-1, seed yield plant-1, number of branches plant-1 and 1000-seed weight. Stepwise regression analysis showed that number of heads plant-1 explained 45.57% and along with seed yield plant-1, number of branches plant-1 and 1000- seed weight explained 81.63% of total variations for seed yield (kg ha-1)."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:21:13Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Safflower;"},{"subject":"nitrogen fertilizer;"},{"subject":"plant density;"},{"subject":"statistical models;"},{"subject":"polynomial regression;"},{"subject":"correlation;"},{"subject":"stepwise regression."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-17","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-17","titles":[{"title":"Modeling The Influence Of Nitrogen Rate And Plant Density On Seed Yield, Yield Components And Seed Quality Of Safflower"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8227","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:33Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8227","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Place and Duration of Study: The University of Uyo Teaching and Research Farm, located at Use Offot - Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria and was conducted between March, 06 and June, 06 in both 2009 and 2010 cropping seasons. Methodology: Treatments were various combinations of organic and inorganic fertilizers applied to the soil, and these included NPK (15:15:15) at 400 kg ha-1, poultry manure (PM) at 5 t ha-1, PM at 2.5 tha-1 + NPK at 200 kgha-1, PM at 3.75 tha-1 + NPK at 100 kgha-1 , PM at 1.25 tha-1 + NPK at 300 kgha-1 and control (without amendment). Results: There were significant differences (P&lt;0.05) among treatments in height, number of branches, number of leaves, stem girth, leaf area, and total foliage yield of waterleaf in both years. Generally, application of PM alone and complementary use of PM and NPK, irrespective of the ratio, enhanced waterleaf growth and total foliage yield better compared to application of NPK alone and the control treatment. Total foliage yield from 100 kgha-1 NPK + 3.75 tha-1 of PM treatment (56 .03 tha-1 30 and 54 36 tha-1 31 in 2009 and 2010, respectively) superseded other treatments by 38 - 78% in 2009 and 35 -78% in 2010. Conclusion: With the high cost, scarcity, and environmental problems associated with the use of mineral fertilizer in Nigeria; and based on the foliage yield obtained in this study, it is obvious that the use of organic manure in combination with mineral fertilizer (particularly with 100kgha-1 NPK + 3.75tha-1 PM or 200kgha-1 NPK + 2.5tha-1 PM treatment) can sustain waterleaf production.

Study Design: The current status of indigenous chicken householders of the urban, semiurban and rural areas was surveyed. Availability of a large number of chickens and good communications facilitated data collection from the study areas. Place and Duration of Study: The study areas included six Upazillas (Sub-Districts) of Rajshahi, Bangladesh viz., Boalia, Godagari, Motihar, Mohonpur, Poba and Rajpara. Data were collected during the period from July 2010 to June 2011. Methodology: Stratified random sampling techniques were used to collect the experimental data through direct interview schedules. A total of 150 households (6 Upazillas × 5 villages × 5 households per village) were selected where the average flock size was 30 birds, consisting of 12 chicks, 12 growers, 4 hens and 2 cocks. Results: Management practices, production performance, associations between production parameters and profitability of indigenous chicken rearing in Rajshahi, Bangladesh were evaluated. The farmers raised their chickens in 6ft×4ft×4ft shed made of mud, straw, bamboo, wood and tin and they practiced traditional methods that included the uses of ash and lime to control ecto-parasites and floor disinfections, respectively. They also maintained regular vaccination programmes. The chickens of the study areas died of various diseases including bacillary white diarrhea (BWD, 39.56%), Newcastle disease (38.89%) and fowl cholera (32.29%). Moreover, disturbances from wild animals provided negative impact on rearing that caused appreciable mortality (3.15%) of the chicks. The indigenous poultry farmers opined that they are facing problems in terms of capital shortage, lack of institutional credit facilities, medicine and veterinary services. Weight of day-old chicks (WDC) was highest in Mohonpur and Rajpara and lowest in Boalia; growth rate (GR) was higher in Boalia and Mohonpur but lower in Godagari and Poba. The death rate (DR) was lower in all Upazillas except Boalia. The fertility rate (FR) and hatchability (HT) were higher in Boalia and Mohonpur and lowest in Poba. The higher first laying age (FLA) was found in Godagari and Mohonpur, whereas the average egg production (AEP) was found higher in Mohonpur, Poba and Rajpara but lowest in Boalia. The average chicken raised (ACR) was higher in Motihar and Poba while lower in Godagari and Mohonpur. The average marketable size (AMS) was highest in Boalia and lowest in Motihar. Most of the production parameters showed positive and significant correlations. With regards to rearing indigenous chickens, profitability calculated as cost-benefit ratio (CBR) was estimated to be 1.24 and 1.19 per family and per bird, respectively. Conclusion: The study revealed some vital information on management practices and productivity of indigenous chickens where profits for rearing indigenous chickens per family and per bird were BDT 0.24 and BDT 0.19, respectively. The raising of indigenous chickens in urban, semi-urban and rural areas of Rajshahi, Bangladesh, therefore appeared to be an efficiently feasible enterprise which requires better understanding of the socio-economic aspects of the small-scale poultry farmers."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:21:48Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Management practices;"},{"subject":"production parameters;"},{"subject":"average egg production;"},{"subject":"average marketable size;"},{"subject":"cost-benefit ratio."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-11","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-11","titles":[{"title":"Production Performance Of Indigenous Chicken (Gallus Domesticus L.)

Study Design: A multi-stage random sampling technique was employed to select 90 poultry farmers. Structured questionnaires and personal interviews were used to collect cross sectional data used in the study. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in Ikot Ekpene senatorial district of Akwa Ibom state in Southern Nigeria. Methodology: Independent double hurdle model was specified and used to determine factors influencing credit accessibility and demand among poultry farmers in the study area. Various tests were conducted to validate the used of the model. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was also employed to test the multi-collinearity among variables used in the analysis. Results: Empirical result from the first hurdle model revealed that the farmers’ age, gender, farm size, membership of social organization, extension agent visits, distance from the borrower’s (farmer) resident to lending source, years of formal education and household size are important determinants of access to credit in the study area. On the other hand, the amount of loan demanded by the poultry farmers was significantly influenced by the farmers’ experience in poultry business, cost of hired labour, previous years of experience on credit, present of surety, farm size, perceived loan repayment period, years of formal education and net farm income. Conclusion: poultry farmers in the study area should form cooperative societies to take advantage of ease of accessing and obtaining credit from credit institutions. The extension system in the study area should be strengthened for effective information dissemination especially on credit issues. Operators of credit institutions should endeavor to locate some of the lending outfits nearer to the poultry farmers. Also, to increase the demand for credit in the study area, the study advocated for the re-assessment of the collateral needs of the lending agents and the duration of loan to the poultry farmers among others."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:22:06Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Poultry;"},{"subject":"access;"},{"subject":"demand;"},{"subject":"credit;"},{"subject":"farmers;"},{"subject":"Akwa Ibom;"},{"subject":"Ikot Ekpene."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-03-09","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-03-09","titles":[{"title":"Determinants Of Credit Access And Demand Among Poultry Farmers In Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8230","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:34Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8230","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Trends in population growth in the country indicate that the demand for maize is projected to increase 3-4% annually. Production is however hampered by the predominance of fragile ecosystems (acidic soils), low soil fertility and low use of chemical inputs. The average grain yield is less than 1.0 t ha-1 instead of a reachable 5.0 t ha-1, leading to vicious cycle of food insecurity. An on-farm experiment was conducted in two soil types (Alfisols and Ultisols) in Kakamega, western Kenya, between February and September 2007 to test effects of various organic inputs (Farmyard manure, Tithonia biomass and Desmodium cover crop) in combination with inorganic fertilizers (N, P, K, Mg, B and Zn) on yield of maize. The design was Randomized Complete Block Design, replicated 5 times and the data was subjected to ANOVA and DMRT tests. Soil analysis before planting indicated that pH was 5.0 and 5.4 in Alfisols and Ultisols, respectively. Both soils were deficient in N and P but adequate in exchangeable bases (K, Ca and Mg). Maize grain yield was higher in Ultisols compared to Alfisols. In Alfisols, organic inputs in combination with 30 kg N ha-1 gave maize grain yield improvement of nearly 100% over farmer’s practice (non improved maize variety, wider plant spacing, inorganic fertilizer applied at the rate of 20 N + 20 P ha-1, one weeding). When inorganic fertilizer (60 kg N + 60 kg P ha-1) was applied to maize/banana intercrop, maize yield increased by about 40%. In contrast, in Ultisols, organic inputs increased maize grain yield by between 85% and 115%, while maize/banana intercrop (plus 60 kg N + 60 kg P ha-1) increased maize grain yield by only 4% over the farmer’s practice. Banana intercrop reduced maize population resulting in low maize grain and stover yield. Use of either farmyard manure, tithonia biomass or desmonium cover crop in combination with 30 kg of N ha-1 (from inorganic source) can enhance maize production among smallholder farmers in acidic soils who ordinarily cannot afford to purchase adequate quantities of inorganic fertilizers."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:23:04Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Alfisols;"},{"subject":"Ultisols;"},{"subject":"maize;"},{"subject":"organic inputs;"},{"subject":"sustainable production;"},{"subject":"Western Kenya."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-24","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-24","titles":[{"title":"Use Of Organic Inputs In Management Of Alfisols And Ultisols For Sustainable Maize Production In Western Kenya"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8233","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:34Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8233","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: Two sites which are the slime dams at a local gold mine in Bindura and a control site 10km outside the slimes were used in the study. A total of four sampling points each in the form of 5x5m quadrants were established after every 100m in transects, 700m long separately established on the control and slime dams. Soil samples at 5-10cm and 10- 15cm levels as well as roots, leaves and bark from five sampled plants were collected at each sampling point. The metals content was analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma. The bioaccumulation factor and the shoot/root quotient were computed in Microsoft excel. Analysis of Variance was carried out using SPSS and Genstat Version 16. Results: The present study shows that A. saligna and A. polyacantha accumulate heavy metals with biological accumulation factor (BAF) value results indicating significant differences between the slimes and control sites.

Study Design: Completely randomized design (CRD) with three treatments each with three replicates. Place and Duration of Study: In the farm station of Gazi fish culture ltd. at Koilashgong, Khulna, Bangladesh between March to June 2011. Methodology: Nine ponds were selected and all ponds were prepared according to the general pond preparation system. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tested post larvae (PL15) were stocked at three different stocking densities i.e. 8 pcs/m2 (T1), 15 pcs/m2 (T2) and 22 pcs/m2 (T3). Commercial shrimp feed were supplied to all the treatments. Feed were adjusted according to the body weight gain of shrimp. Probiotics were applied in all the treatments to prevent diseases and maintain water quality parameters. Monthly water samples were collected for analysis and growth parameters were measured. Results: Results showed that all the water quality parameters were within the optimum range. Highest survival was found in T2 (82±4) and lowest was recorded in T3 (68±2) (P&lt;0.05). Harvesting size of shrimp varied from 29.0±1.53 g to 38.5±0.5 g. Harvesting size was smaller in T3 than in T1 and T2 (P&lt;0.05). Stocking density of 15 and 22 pcs/m2 exhibited the highest production of 4635.1±128 kg/ha/crop and 4328.7±138.2 kg/ha/crop respectively whereas, T1 showed lowest (2431.3±35.2 kg/ha/crop). It was observed that two crops can be found from each pond/year. Net profit calculation showed that highest net profit was found in T2 compared to other treatments (P&gt;0.05).

Three major vegetable producing communities were selected as study sites with seventy five (75) key informants interviewed. Soil and water samples were obtained to determine the extent of soil and water contamination with pesticides and fertilizers. There was a high level of awareness on the negative impacts of commercial pesticides and fertilizers on soil, water and human health but awareness did not influence the way farmers utilize pesticides and dispose of empty bottles/containers of pesticides after use. Soil samples from Balili, Mankayan, Benguet and Sadsadan, Mt. Province contain variable amounts of pesticide residues in the top 15 centimeter soil surface. The residues detected were: chlorpyrifos, profenofos, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate. Chlorpyrifos was found in one soil sample in Sadsadan above the Limit of Determination. Similarly, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and fenvalerate were found in two soil samples in Balili higher than the limit of determination. No pesticide residue was found in all soil samples obtained from the inner 200 centimeter soil depth. Soils in the garden sites of Tinoc, Ifugao were still pesticide free. Water samples in all the sites contain no pesticide residues but found to contain high levels of coliform bacteria. Pesticide contamination of soil and water was not as severe as anticipated but rather it is the presence of coliform bacteria severely contaminating water bodies in the area. Natural springs unspoiled by human population are still clean and potable. Nitrate levels in soil and water is low but showed some signs of building up due to the continuous application of fertilizers. Hospital records showed no reported cases of pesticide poisoning due to improper handling. However, there were cases of intentional ingestion of pesticides for purposes of committing suicides.

Methodology: Five weed control treatments evaluated against unweeded control were; Codal gold(R) (250g prometryne + 162.5 g metolachlor per litre) at a rate of 1.65 kg a.i ha-1, Galex(R) (Metolachlor 250g + metobromuron 250g per litre) at the rate of 3.0 kg a.1.ha-1; Pendilin(R) (Pendimethalin 500g per litre) at a rate of 2.0 kg a.i ha-1, one hoe – weeding at 3 weeks after planting (WAP) and two hoe weeding at 3 and 7 WAP. Results: Herbicides treatments and hoe weeded twice gave an acceptable (³70%) weed control in both years. Cowpea yield was best under Codal gold at 1.65 kg a.i ha-1 (with an average yield of ≥ 1600kg ha-1) while the unweeded control had the poorest yield (between 800 and 900 kg ha-1) in both years. The highest profit was obtained under Codal gold at 1.65 kg a.i ha-1 and the lowest in plot hoe weeded twice. The highest cost benefit ratio (CBR) of 24.61 in 2005 and 28.21 in 2006 were recorded with Codal goldR treated plot while the lowest of 1.25 and 1.22 were obtained in 2005 and 2006 respectively under plot hoe weeded twice. Conclusion: Codal gold(R) at 1.65 kg a.i ha-1 was better than the other herbicides tried, in reducing weed infestation in cowpea as evidenced on the performance, yield of cowpea and higher economic returns.

This led to a need to evaluate seed morphology of different bottle gourd landraces and its effect on seed quality as defined by germination and vigour. Methodology: Six mature fruits of different bottle gourd landraces were collected from subsistence farmers and seeds from each fruit were morphologically characterized. Standard germination test, root: shoot ratio, seedling fresh mass, seedling dry mass, germination velocity index (GVI) and electrical conductivity were used to establish seed quality and vigour. Results: Although all traits were significantly different, most of them were not good indicators of seed quality. Seed coat thickness isolated varieties by provenance and was inversely proportional to root: shoot ratio as a measure of seedling establishment.

Methodology: Three different planting dates were used as the main-plot treatments, while staking and non-staking formed the sub-plots. Seven accessions of AYB were planted in the sub-plots. Five plants were randomly selected from each accession/treatment and tagged for data collection. Each seedling was staked independent after germination, while the non-staked plants were allowed to trail on the ground guided. Collected data were subjected to analyses of variance. Mean separation was carried out by Fisher’s protected LSD test. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to determine the relationship between yields, planting dates and staking. Results: The results indicated that all the AYB accessions performed better when they were staked and planted earlier in May of each season with greater seed/tuber yields, which differed significantly (P &lt; 0.028) from those that were not staked and planted later in each of the season. Of all the accessions assessed, TSs86 was the most productive with the highest seed yield and differed significantly (P &lt; 0.015) from the rest except TSs48 that even gave better seed yield during 2010, while TSs84 had the least seed yields.

Combined analysis of variance showed significant differences for total dry matter, WUE, relative water loss (transpiration efficiency), and initial water of flag leaves (uptake efficiency). Sardary, Sabalan and Alamut cultivars had the lowest WUE and total dry matter, but Zarrin and Shahriar were the highest values. Sardary with low uptake efficiency and Zarrin with high grain yield had the minimum and maximum transpiration efficiency.

Study Design: Randomized complete block design with three replications where the variable factor was water regime.

Methodology: Seven treatments of supplemental irrigation were tested, individually during one day at, beginning of stage I of fruit development (Ta); beginning of stage II (Tb); beginning of stage III (Tc) and in combination of two irrigations, Ta and Tb (Tab), Ta and Tc (Tac), and Tb and Tc (Tbc) in addition to three irrigations Ta, Tb and Tc (Tabc), and no irrigation used as control (Td). Treatments were applied to thirty years old olive trees (cv. Picholine Marocaine) planted at a distance of 8x6 m, at experimental field of Regional Agricultural Research Center of Meknes in North-center of Morocco. Amount of each watering was equivalent to the easily usable water-reserve on 70 cm of soil depth (0.5 m3/tree). Results and Discussion: Fruit weight and shoot length were more affected by treatment Ta as compared to the rainfed regime, and hence fruit and oil yields were increased, in average, respectively by 43% and 37%. Water use efficiency for this treatment was 23 kg.m-3.tree-1. Treatments Tb and Tc improved only oil content and shoot growth without significant changes in yield. However, their combination with Ta (Tabc) increased fruit yield by an average of 106%. The effect observed under the tested irrigations was related to the importance of fruit growth kinetics during water application.

In order for small farms to survive, however, management strategies are needed that simultaneously yield high value fruits and vegetables and also enable farmers to remain economically solvent. The research reported here tested the economic and productive feasibility of implementing irrigation in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L. Lam) production in Mississippi US. Historical production records and management expenses were used to determine sweet potato production expenses and returns over a ten-year period from 2002 - 2011. Crop water use over this 10-year period was calculated from historical weather records. Yield improvements resulting from implementing irrigation were then used to determine potential increased return on investment. Irrigation costs increased yearly production expenses 3-4%, depending on pumping fuel costs. Costs associated with harvest and post-harvest processing of the greater yields added an additional 8 – 70% to production expenses, depending on yield increase. However, even very modest (10%) improvements in yield are sufficient to economically justify implementing irrigation, as the net return on investment increased by 5% or more. Irrigation is a relatively simple tool that farmers could use to enhance their management practices and maximize profits. However, access to startup capital and knowledge of irrigation management are still critically needed to assist small, limited resource farmers in adopting tools and skills that will improve the output and economic return of their production systems. The results from this research will be used to develop management tools for farmers to improve access to production information and assist in making crop management and business decisions."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:27:16Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Economic return of irrigation;"},{"subject":"limited-resource production;"},{"subject":"vegetable production systems;"},{"subject":"irrigation expense."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-24","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-24","titles":[{"title":"The Economic Feasibility Of Implementing Irrigation In Small, Limited Resource Farming Systems"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8247","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:36Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8247","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted in central Oklahoma in 2005 and 2007 and in south-central Texas in 2008 and 2009. Methodology: Serial dates of measurement over the growing season of leaf area index, light extinction coefficient for Beer's Law, and the radiation use efficiency were used to quantify these growth parameters for simulation modeling. Results: All assayed grasses in the exotic warm-season perennial grasses functional group had similar values for LAI (mean = 4), k (mean = -0.5), and RUE (mean = 1.3 g MJ-1 IPAR). Conclusion: When these parameters were applied in a simulation model, the model successfully simulated mean yields near the reported yields for exotic warm-season perennial grasses on all simulated soils in Texas and Oklahoma and in Mexico.

A key premise of commercialization as a development strategy is that markets provide increased incomes to households who are able to maximize the returns to land and labor through market opportunities, using earned income for household consumption in ways that are more efficient than subsistence production. This study assesses the characteristics of smallholder farmers in Ghana using tomato and pineapple production as a case study; analyses the relationship between commercialization and smallholder land holdings; assesses the determinants of commercialization of smallholder agriculture, as well as the benefits or otherwise of smallholder farmers from commercialization; and discusses how commercialization affects household food security among smallholder farmers. Descriptive statistics, correlations and regression analysis are used to describe the characteristics of smallholder farmers and determine the key factors that influence household decision to undertake commercialization among both tomato and pineapple farmers. Based on the study, it was found that 96.3 percent of the respondents in the study communities are farmers; and they fall between the ages of 15 and 59 years (91%), which indicates that they are relatively young. The key determinants of commercialization among tomato farmers are land productivity and labour productivity. Similarly, the main determinants of commercialization among pineapple smallholder farmers are land productivity and savings. The study recommends that both public and private agencies work should together to facilitate the move of smallholder farmers from mainly subsistence to commercialization because it comes with several benefits, including higher household incomes, and improvements in household food security."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:28:15Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Smallholder farmer;"},{"subject":"commercialization;"},{"subject":"determinants;"},{"subject":"productivity;"},{"subject":"income."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-15","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-15","titles":[{"title":"Determinants Of Commercialization Of Smallholder Tomato And Pineapple Farms In Ghana"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8250","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:36Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8250","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Methodology: A two-factor, field experiment was conducted on Alfisols formed of a sandy loam in the north-central Poland. The N rates were [kg·ha-1]: 0, 40, 80, 120, 160. The second factor was the catch crops – that were investigated – field pea (Pisum sativum var. arvense L.), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiformis L.), and a control without a catch crop. The main studied features were spring wheat yield and its components, depending on nitrogen rates. Moreover the most economic rate of nitrogen for spring wheat in years with different amount of rainfall were calculated. Results: The optimal rate of nitrogen in spring wheat cultivation depended mainly on the total precipitation that prevailed during its growth. The highest grain yield of this plant grown after catch crops could be obtained applying 140-160 kg N∙ha-1 in the year with a very good supply of rain water and 41-42 kg N∙ha-1, in the extremely dry year. The effect of catch crops on the yield of spring wheat depended on the rate of nitrogen. Very large increase in grain yield was obtained when no nitrogen was applied. After the application of 120 and 160 kg N∙ha-1 there was no effect of catch crops on spring wheat productivity. Conclusion: The most economic rate of nitrogen for spring wheat was lower than the agronomically optimal rate by about 30% in the year with a favourable rainfall distribution. In the extremely dry year, the nitrogen fertilization of spring wheat grown after catch crops was economically unjustified. The effect of catch crops on grain yield was positive only in spring wheat fertilized with nitrogen at a rate of up to 80 kg∙ha-1."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:28:49Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Efficiency;"},{"subject":"nitrogen fertilization;"},{"subject":"wheat;"},{"subject":"catch crop."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-05-10","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-05-10","titles":[{"title":"The Efficiency Of Nitrogen Fertilization Of Spring Wheat Depending On Seasonal Rainfall"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8252","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:36Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8252","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Chemistry, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria. Study was carried out between January and April, 2004. Methodology: To 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg of Ti or CaHap powder, 10 mL of (1% or 5%) mucin solution already incubated at 37oC was added at a contact time of 45 minutes in an incubator. After discarding the supernatant, a 10 mL volume of doubly distilled water was added to each residue and rinsed to remove the unadsorbed mucin. The adsorbent particles with the adsorbed mucin of an experimental group was then heated to 60oC for five hours in an oven and then weighed. The samples were then placed in a muffle-furnace at 600oC for 30 minutes to remove the mucin by burning, so as to obtain the weight of adsorbed mucin. For the experiment on the adsorptive strength, to seven sets of 500 mg Ti or CaHap powder 10 mL of 1% mucin solution was added in an incubator. After centrifugation, the supernatant solution above the titanium particles was removed from the precipitates, and 8 mL of distilled water incubated at 37oC added; after shaking, the supernatant was again removed by the same method. The same rinsing procedure as described above was repeated 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12 times in different experimental groups. The Ti or CaHap particles were heated to 60oC for 5 hours in an oven and weighed. The adsorptive strength was evaluated by comparing the weight change between the no rinse and multiple rinse samples. One gramme of Ti or CaHap powder placed in test tubes was suspended in 1.0 mL of solutions containing 0.2 – 1.8 mg/mL mucin solution. Following constant shaking for 24 hours at 37oC, the suspensions were allowed to settle and the supernatants collected to determine the adsorption isotherms. Bradford assay was performed on 0.1 mL supernatant samples to obtain Langmuir adsorption isotherm for the materials. Results: The amount of mucin adsorbed to CaHap was 1.79 ± 0.65 times higher than that to Ti. At the eighth rinse mucin particles remain adsorbed to CaHap but none on the Ti surfaces. The adsorption isotherms of mucin onto both materials exhibited the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, with a maximum of 0.14 mg mucin adsorbed/ 1.0 g CaHap powder compared to a maximum of 0.11 mg mucin/ 1.0 g Ti powder reported by Lori and Nok, (2004). Conclusion: Mucin can be completely rinsed from the surfaces of artificial titanium tooth and braces deployed in the mouth, thereby prolonging the lifespan. Adsorption of mucin onto these two biomaterial surfaces exhibited the Langmuir type with similarity, so bioengineered Ti-Hap composite has excellent biocompatibility. The results of these in vitro experiments were consistent with the proposal that ceramics have a higher adsorptive ability than do metals."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:29:43Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Calcium hydroxyapatite;"},{"subject":"titanium;"},{"subject":"mucin;"},{"subject":"adsorption;"},{"subject":"isotherm."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-07-05","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-07-05","titles":[{"title":"A Comparative Study Of The Adsorptive Characteristics Of Mucin To Calcium Hydroxyapatite And Titanium Implants"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8255","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:37Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8255","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The main objective of this paper is to study the quantum yield (Φ) variation with respect to change of mole fraction (x2)of solvents in aquation reactions of these Cr (III) complexes in mixed solvent media and to interpret the results in the light of statistical analysis to give meaningful qualitative and quantitative treatment. Study design: The linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) is employed to correlate the Φ data with various empirical solvent parameters in single and multiple statistical equations. Methodology: Visible light photolysis was carried out for the [Cr Lm Cln](3-n)+ complexes in water containing either methanol (MeOH) or 1,4-dioxane (Diox), x2 (xMeOH/xDiox) 0, 0.029/0.0109 to 0.1602/0.0831, respectively. Results: Photolysis of these complexes in these binary mixtures is good to excellent for few complexes and poor for the remaining cases. Solvent assisted photolysis in the binary solvent mixtures produced aquated products. In principle, the photoaquation takes place by associative mechanism and quantum yield for this reaction was found to exhibit linear x2 dependence. Conclusion: In summary, the available model analysis allows a definitive choice of the above two alternative pathways according an increase or decrease in Φ value at higher mole fractions of MeOH/Diox in the medium. This conclusion is more appealing and in order to gain more insight into the problem. This model analysis is extremely important because it can yield both qualitative (bulk solvent effect) and quantitative (short range solvation effect) information that may otherwise be difficult to arrive at."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:30:01Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Cr (III) complexes;"},{"subject":"molecular dynamics;"},{"subject":"photo aquation reaction;"},{"subject":"solvation effect;"},{"subject":"statistical model;"},{"subject":"regression model."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-06-25","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-06-25","titles":[{"title":"Correlation Of Photosubstitution Quantum Efficiencies Of [Cr Lm Cln](3-N)+ Complexes With Solvent Properties In Mixed Solvents By Statistical Relationships"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8256","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:37Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8256","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Organic solvents are high on the list of toxic compounds due to the problems in containing volatile compounds and the sheer large volume of them used in industry. Some advantages of utilizing solventless reactions are that the compounds are often sufficiently pure to avoid extensive purification using chromatography, the reactions can be rapid, and often reaching substantial completion in several minutes compared to hours in organic solvents, and the energy usage can be much lower. Among organic reactions, aldol condensations are important and excellent tools in organic synthesis, providing a good way to form carbon–carbon bonds. The main objectives of this paper are to carryout crossed - aldol condensation reactions with dicyclohexylketones with different aromatics aldehydes in the presence of silica sulphuric acid [SiO2.OSO3H] as an ionic liquid catalyst under solvent free condition to afford the corresponding α, β - unsaturated crossed - aldol products in excellent yields and to recover and reuse the catalyst for subsequent use. Study design: Green chemical reaction using silica-sulphuric acid as a catalyst under solventless condition. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Chemistry, Sir Theagaraya College, Chennai-21, Tamilnadu, India, between June 2009 and July 2010. Methodology: The ionic liquid SiO2.OSO3H was prepared according to the reported procedure in an eco-friendly way by the reaction of silica gel and chlorosulphonic acid .It is interesting to note that the reaction is easy, clean and not requiring any work-up procedure. Using this ionic liquid, crossed-aldol condensation of dicyclohexyl ketones with aromatic aldehydes were carried out. After complete conversion of the ketones as indicated by the TLC, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Dichloromethane (20 - 30 ml) was added and heated for a few minutes, the reagent was concentrated and the solid residue was recrystallized from ethanol to afford the pure product. The catalyst was recycled by washing the solid reagent remained on the filter by EtOAC (20 ml) followed by drying in an oven (50oC) for 2hr. Products were characterized by spectral analyses such as UV-Visible, FT-IR,1H NMR and 13C NMR. Results: The reactions were completed with excellent yields (90 - 95%) within 2 - 5 hr at the temperature range of 80-85oC. The reaction does not require any additional catalyst because the ionic liquid itself acts as a catalyst and solvent as well in these experiments, the products were isolated and the remaining catalyst was washed and reloaded with fresh substrates benzaldehyde and dicyclohexyl ketones. Under these conditions, no selfcondition of the starting materials was observed. When similar reactions were carried out in sulphuric acid (conventional acid catalyst), a mixture of products was obtained in poor yields One of the greatest advantages of the reagent SiO2.OSO3H is that it is recoverable and reusable for several times without potential loss in its catalytic activity. Conclusion: The conventional esterification reactions (without ionic liquids) suffer from many problems like poor efficiency, side reactions, consumption of huge environmentally hazardous chemicals, etc., The use of ionic liquids for these reactions eradicate the aforementioned problems encountered in the conventional procedures."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:30:36Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Green synthesis;"},{"subject":"ionic liquid;"},{"subject":"silica sulphuric acid;"},{"subject":"crossed-aldol condensation;"},{"subject":"dicyclohexylketones;"},{"subject":"solvent less reaction."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-05-21","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-05-21","titles":[{"title":"A Facile Tandem Protocol For The Crossed Aldol Condensation In Sio2.Oso3H Ionic Liquid Under Solventless Condition"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8258","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:37Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8258","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

First stage is the synthesis of silica sulphuric acid ionic liquid in an eco-friendly way by the reaction of silica gel and chlorosulphonic acid .It is interesting to note that the reaction is easy, clean and not requiring any work-up procedure. Second stage is the Fisher esterification reaction of a variety of carboxylic acids and alcohol utilizing silica sulphuric acid. Third stage is the purification of products by chromatographic techniques. The fourth stage id the characterization of all the products by spectral methods. Fifth stage is the comparison of the catalytic efficiency of silica sulphuric acid with the conventional sulphuric acid catalyst. Results: The silica supported sulphuric acid is bench top reagent which is easy to handle with better accessibility of the reactants to the active sites. Fisher esterification reactions were completed with excellent yields (97 - 99%) within 1.5 - 8 hr at the temperature range of 80-135oC. The reaction does not require any additional catalyst because the ionic liquid itself acts as a catalyst and solvent as well in these experiments, the products were isolated and the remaining catalyst was washed and reloaded with fresh substrates. When similar reactions were carried out in sulphuric acid (conventional acid catalyst), a mixture of products was obtained in poor yields One of the greatest advantages of the reagent sio2.oso3h is that it is recoverable and reusable for several times without potential loss in its catalytic activity. Conclusion: The results indicated that the silica sulphuric acid exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the esterification reaction and better yield (with high degree of purity) under mild reaction conditions than those reactions without ionic liquid. After the reaction was over, the ionic liquid was regenerated and reused with no appreciable change in activity. In conclusion the present method is a very efficient and selective protocol for esterification reactions of carboxylic acids with alcohols and a high yield synthesis of the required ester in the presence of reversible and environmentally benign catalyst. Simple work-up procedure, including washing the mixture followed by evaporation of the solvent is another advantage of this method."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:31:10Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Green synthesis;"},{"subject":"ionic liquid;"},{"subject":"silica sulphuric acid;"},{"subject":"Fisher esterification reaction;"},{"subject":"solvent less reaction;"},{"subject":"Green chemical reaction."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-05-21","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-05-21","titles":[{"title":"Silica Sulphuric Acid Catalyzed Fischer Esterification Reaction Under Solventless Condition: A Novel Green Chemical Reaction"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8260","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:38Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8260","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

This paper gives an overview of their properties, basic chemistry and conditions of formation in internal combustion engines. Again worldwide many countries are promoting alternative fuels to tackle the crisis of traditional fuel. But the impact of this movement toward alternative fuels with respect to toxic emissions has not been well studied. Therefore, in this paper the analysis on the effects of engine operation and fuelling parameters is also reviewed with specific references in gasoline, diesel, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol blended petrol and Biodiesel fuelled engines. This is accompanied by the review of the studies of the performance of exhaust catalytic converters with respect to aldehydes, ketones and methane.

Fresh shoots of Tithonia diversifolia were collected from the University environment and blended using pestle and mortar to make the fresh shoot biomass (FSB). The FSB was weighed into 50g, 100g, 150g and 200g and thoroughly mixed with collected soils in horticultural pots. The soil sample had already been autoclaved at 100oc for 24hr. The control experiment recorded the highest emergence percentage but similar to the 50g FSB of T. diversifolia recorded. Higher FSB resulted to lower emergence percentage. Growth parameters in terms of plant height stem girth, number of leaves per plant and leave area were highest in the 150g Tithonia diversifolia FSB but lowest in the control. The highest yield of cowpea was obtained in the 150g Tithonia diversifolia FSB applied pots which was similar to those of 100g FSB applied pots. The stimulatory growth factor and yield increase enhanced by FSB of Tithonia diversifolia is an indication that Tithonia diversifolia possesses no negative allelopathic effect on cowpea growth. The poor seedling emergence observed suggests that the land be left for some time to allow proper degrading of the Tithonia diversifolia before planting cowpea. This study further revealed that fallowed land occupied by Tithonia diversifolia could be successfully used to produce optimum cowpea yield."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:31:45Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Cowpea;"},{"subject":"Tithonia diversifolia;"},{"subject":"fresh shoot biomass;"},{"subject":"growth and yield."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-08-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-08-28","titles":[{"title":"Study On The Effects Of Fresh Shoot Biomass Of Tithonia Diversifolia On The Germination, Growth And Yield Of Cowpea (Vigna Unguiculata L.)"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8262","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:38Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8262","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The sub-plot consists of 4 rows 5 m long with 60 cm and 10 cm inter and intra-row spacing. Place and Duration: El Gantra, Range and Pasture Farm in Sennar State of the Sudan during 2009 and 2010 cropping season. Methodology: Five soybean genotypes NA 5009 RG; TGx 1904-6F, TGx 1740-2F, TGx 1937-1F and Soja were evaluated. A strain of Rhizobium japonicum was used for inoculation at a rate of 10 g per kg of soybean seed using a sugary solution in 2009. Inoculation was not carried out due to the assumption that the field had the remnant of inoculum effect in 2010. All the recommended soybean agronomic practices were equally applied. Number of days to 50% flowering was recorded on plot basis when almost half of the sub-plot flowers. Ten plants were randomly selected on plot basis to quantify these traits: Plant height was measured as from ground surface to the base of meri-stem of the mother plant. Number of branches was computed as an average count of branches per plant. Leaf area was computed using Iamauti [12] empirical relationship. The first pod height was measured at full bloom. Number of seeds per pod was counted at physiological maturity of the crop. 100-seed weight was determined randomly from a seed bulk using a digital weighing machine. Seed yield was quantified after harvest and converted into kg/hectare. Results: The effect of genotype (G), environment (E) and G × E interactions on pod number per plant; plant height, first pod height, number of branches per plant, leaf area, number of days to 50% flowering and seed yield were found significant at P=0.05. The highest mean seed yield was obtained from TGx 1937-1F (0.98 t/ha). Beside TGx 1740-2F, TGx 1904-6F and Soja were significantly higher than NA 5009 RG in all environments for seed yield. TGx 1937-1F was an intermediate maturing and best in terms of number of pods per plant, number of branches per plant, and leaf area. Correlation coefficient for seed yield showed significant association with days to 50% flowering and leaf area. Conclusion: The best genotype for seed yield across the environments was TGx 1937-1F and TGx 1740-2F, TGx1904-6F and Soja were intermediate and NA 5009 RG was the least.

Therefore, there is the need to investigate the effect of spatial arrangement of maize/cowpea on the performance of maize and cowpea. The experiment was a 2 x 5 factorial in randomized complete block design. A field experiment was conducted at Federal College of Education, Osiele, Abeokuta, Nigeria during the late cropping seasons of 2009 and 2010. The intercrop proportion mixture and population adopted in this study were additive and replacement series while Oloyin and Sokoto cowpea varieties were combined with TZESR-W maize variety as follows: Oloyin + maize in alternate row, Oloyin + maize in alternate row, Oloyin + maize in alternate stand, Oloyin + maize in strip cropping, Sokoto + maize in alternate row, Sokoto + maize in alternate row, Sokoto + maize in alternate stand, Sokoto + maize in strip cropping, sole maize, Sole cowpea. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was used to determine the productivity of the intercrop. The grain yield of cowpea obtained from alternate row intercrop and sole cowpea for 2009 and 2010 were similar. However, the grain yield of cowpea obtained from alternate row was 33, 37 and 59% higher than alternated stand, alternate row replacement and strip crop, respectively. Oloyin variety had significantly higher grain yield than Sokoto. Interaction of cowpea variety x spatial arrangement x cropping season was significant on 1000-seed weight. The two additive series had higher land equivalent ratio compared to replacement series. Maize yield was not affected in two additive series. In conclusion, intercrop was more productive than sole.

The current study therefore investigated (i) the effect of soil amendments; lime (L), minjingu phosphate rock (MPR) and manure (FYM) on soil available P and its uptake, phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) and maize grain yield of long (H614) and short (H513) maturing maize hybrids and (ii) the relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) of MPR. Field experiments were set up at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Molo during the long rain seasons of 2009 and 2010. A randomized complete block design with a 23 factorial arrangement was used for the first objective. The factors, each at two levels, were L (0 and 3 t ha-1), MPR (0 and 60 kg P ha-1) and FYM (0 and 5 t ha-1) giving a total of eight treatments; C (control), L, MPR, FYM, L+MPR, L+FYM, FYM+MPR and L+FYM+MPR. The relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) of MPR was determined in a parallel experiment laid out in randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement and replicated thrice. Maize hybrid H513 and H614 were the test crops in both experiments and constituted the main plots. The split plots were control (0 kg P ha-1), triple super phosphate (60 kg P ha-1) and MPR (60 kg P ha-1). Soil available P and its uptake, PUE, RAE and maize yields were the parameters measured. The application of soil amendments increased soil available P and its uptake, PUE and maize yields over the control for both maize hybrids. Highest values of the measured parameters were recorded in the L+FYM+MPR treatment and for maize hybrid H614. The two year mean values of relative agronomic efficiency RAE (%) of MPR were 60 (H513) and 66.7 (H614), and significantly higher for the maize hybrid H614. The combined application of soil amendments could thus improve maize productivity and is recommended for the acid soils of Molo County. The maize hybrid H513 though with lower yields, matured faster than H614 and would thus come in handy as an adaptation strategy in the face of climate change and variability. Moreover, it has a low P requirement and a short growth cycle thus making it an ideal variety, economically, for smallholder farmers."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:33:34Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Climate change;"},{"subject":"farm yard manure;"},{"subject":"maize hybrids;"},{"subject":"Minjingu phosphate rock;"},{"subject":"soil acidity."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-08-04","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-08-04","titles":[{"title":"Comparative Effects Of Soil Amendments On Phosphorus Use And Agronomic Efficiencies Of Two Maize Hybrids In Acidic Soils Of Molo County, Kenya"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8268","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:39Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8268","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Place and Duration of Study: Niger Delta region of Nigeria between January and October, 2012. Methodology: Delta State was purposively chosen from the Niger Delta region for the study. A random sampling technique was employed to select 17 cassava farmers each from three (3) oil spillage communities (Otor-Udu, Olomoro and Uzere) and three (3) nonoil spillage communities (Egini, Aradhe and Ellu), giving a total sample size of 102 respondents for the study. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics, Likert scale, t-statistic and regression analysis. Results: The results showed that the major significant effects of oil spillage on cassava production perceived by the farmers included crop failure, poor yield, rotting tubers, and stunted crop growth with mean scores of 4.80, 4.78, 4.75 and 4.75 respectively. Others included increased soil temperature and toxicity (mean: 4.73), reduction of soil fertility (mean: 4.70), degradation of farm land (mean: 4.70) and low land productivity (mean: 4.70). The results further indicated that the cassava farm size, yield and land productivity in oil spillage affected communities were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) lower than those of the nonoil spillage communities by 0.61 ha, 6119 metric tonnes (MT) and 1447 MT/ha respectively. These represent significant reduction of 36, 48 and 20% of these variables in the oil spillage affected communities respectively. About 45% of the variation in land productivity in cassava production was influenced by oil spillage and the farmers’ farming experience. The productivity increased with increase in farming experience but decreased with increase in oil spills. Conclusion: Constant maintenance of the oil pipelines and tankers to prevent corrosion and checking of the activities of saboteurs which often destroy oil pipelines will reduce the incidence of oil spillage, hence increasing cassava production in the Niger Delta region. There is need for further study to know the adaptation measures the farmers employed to minimize the adverse effects of oil spillage on their production; and the mitigating measures by government and the oil companies to deal with oil spillage."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:34:09Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Effect;"},{"subject":"oil;"},{"subject":"spillage;"},{"subject":"cassava;"},{"subject":"production;"},{"subject":"Nigeria."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-24","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-24","titles":[{"title":"Effect Of Oil Spillage On Cassava Production In Niger Delta Region Of Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8270","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:39Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8270","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The present work on “Bio Hydrogen Production from Pharmaceutical Waste Water Treatment by a Suspended Growth Reactor Using Environmental Anaerobic Technology.

The optimization process included the selection of ideal co-substrate (sucrose) and nitrogen source (DAP) to examine the feasibility of hydrogen production from industrial effluent in a 50%-50% mixture of the complex feed and the industrial effluent. Hydrogen gas produced in the reactor is estimated using a gas sensor. This equipment is a generic gas-monitoring instrument with microprocessor based electronics interfacing with std. 4 to 20 mA alarm/control systems. The inlet pH (feed) was maintained at 6 while the outlet pH monitored after detention time showed a slight variation (4 to 5.4) throughout the reaction periods .The variation in Volatile fatty acids (VFA) was evident up to 21 day of operation, and thereafter stabilized in and around 2600 mg/l indicating the steady state condition of the reactor. The alkalinity values variation indicated an increase in system response to acidogenic fermentation process. The variation of COD reduction (%) indicates multitude of variations as the experiment proceeds indicating perfect degradation of the organic substrate present in the culture aimed towards hydrogen production.VFA evaluation through High power liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated presence of acetic acid within the system which could be the possible substrate for hydrogen production. During sequencing phase operation, the hydrogen values given by the experimental run with the effluent as the main substrate showed greater production rate (0.81 mmol/hr) when compared to that produced in the previous cases using only synthetic (0.086 mmol/hr) and complex feeds (0.29 mmol/hr ) respectively.

Methodology: Information was sought through interviews, questionnaires and observations from 15 companies in Msasa. The What If Analysis (WIA) was also used to postulate the potential upsets that may result in accidents. A semi qualitative approximate domino effect analysis procedure was used to simulate the likely sequence of an event after its initiation. Discussion: In the cluster, domino effect was most likely to be initiated and propagated by fires (pool, flash, fireballs or jet), explosions (confined vapour cloud explosions (CVCE), boiling liquid expanding vapour explosions (BLEVE), vented explosions, vapour cloud explosions, and dust explosions) and toxic release with effects ranging from being catastrophic, critical, marginal or negligible. It was found that there has been no domino risk analysis and hence was a strong possibility of destruction of the entire industrial area and neighbouring residential areas in the case of the forecast domino accidents. Toxic and dust releases were most likely to contaminate neighbouring residence leading to exposed toxic substance for long periods after the release.

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria, between March and November, 2011. Methodology: Aluminium sheets of AA1060 and purity 98.98% was used. Each sheet was mechanically press-cut into coupons of dimension 3 cm x 3 cm. The solvents used for extraction of ocimum gratissimum leaf were 1M HCl, ethanol and distilled water, respectively. A hole with diameter 0.5 cm was drilled in each aluminium coupon and suspended in beakers containing test solution using glass hook. The weight loss was determined by retrieving coupons from test solutions at intervals. The coupons were weighed after retrieving. The different in weight was taken as weight loss of aluminium. Results: The percentage of inhibition efficiency (% I.E) was calculated at 303 K and 333 K, respectively. The result indicates that % I.E increases as concentration of inhibitor increases. The trend of inhibition efficiency was in order: Distilled H2O &gt; C2H5OH &gt; 1M HCl. The result indicates that increase in temperature decreases inhibition efficiency and degree of surface coverage. The result shows that apparent activation energy Ea increases as inhibitor concentration increases. The activation energy of distilled water extract range between 45.02 to 79.90 kJ/mol. While the activation energies of ethanol and 1 M HCl extracts of the inhibitor ranges between 35.12 to 72.93 kJ/mol and 26.60 to 65.25 kJ/mol, respectively.

Methodology: Tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) semi-clathrate hydrate aqueous slurry was adopted. The viscosity of solutions and slurries was measured at various concentrations of solution and various solid fractions by use of stress-control-type rheometer. The measurements were performed in the both case without and with cationic surfactant. Additionally, the size and shape and aggregation property of hydrate particles in slurry were evaluated by means of direct observation and zeta potential analysis. Results: The apparent viscosity of both TBAB solution and hydrate slurry increases as the temperature decreases, which is caused by the increase of solid fraction in slurry. The TBAB hydrate slurry behaves like pseudo-plastic fluid. In addition, the effect of minimal surfactant on rheological characteristics of TBAB hydrate slurry was investigated. A very small amount of surfactant drastically reduces the apparent viscosity of TBAB hydrate slurry, and then the morphology of TBAB hydrate particle does not change regardless of the existence of surfactant. From the measurement on zeta potential of the surface of TBAB hydrate particle, the viscosity reduction effect may be caused by the electric repulsion of surfactant-adsorbed hydrate particles.

Methodology: The B. cereus strain used was isolated from contaminated food by using a selective media (Mannitol egg yolk polymyxin agar) and then culturing and storing on nutrient agar slants at –20ºC after biochemical tests were done to identify the isolate. All the microbial batch experiments were carried out at ambient conditions in 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Nutrient broth was autoclaved at 121ºC at 15psi for 15min and nutrient agar plates were also used in the isolation of the B. cereus strain. Effects of various parameters, including initial dye concentration (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0g/l), glucose concentration (50, 100, 200 and 500mg/l), pH (4.0, 7.0 and 10.0) and temperature (20, 27 and 40ºC), on dye decolourization were investigated. Decolourization extent was determined by measuring the absorbance of the culture supernatant at 591nm using a Unicam UV9100-visible spectrophotometer. Decolourization extent was calculated using a standard equation as specified by Giwa et al., 2011. Results: The bacteria culture exhibited 95% decolourization ability within 72 hours. The optimum dye decolourizing activity of the culture was observed at pH 7.0 and incubation temperature of 27ºC. Maximum dye decolourizing efficiency was observed at 200 mg/l concentration of RB19. The dye solution showed high peak at the wavelength of 591nm. Conclusion: The results thus obtained have characterized and identified the dye degrading ability of the B. cereus. The presence of a co-substrate (glucose) is an essential condition for attaining maximum decolourization efficiency.

Study Design: Batch reactor system. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pure and Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Nigeria. The study was carried out between February to August, 2011. Methodology: A sample of the natural clay was collected from the open clay deposit in Ezinachi, Okigwe Local Government Area, Imo state, Nigeria. The clay sample was washed and dried under sunshine for two days. Titanium pillared bentonite was produced by modification of natural bentonite clay using titanium pillaring solution at 500ᶿC. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) and BET gas sorption analysis were employed to characterize the pillared material. Esterification reactions were carried out in a batch mode using a three-necked round bottom glass flask of 250 ml capacity fitted with a reflux condenser and mercury in glass thermometer to monitor the temperature. Heating and stirring was achieved using a magnetic hot plate with a stirrer. Pre-determined amount of acetic acid (for 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 acid: alcohol mole ratio) and the clay catalyst were charged into the reactor and heated to 90 ±0.5ºC. After the desired temperature has been reached, a known amount of ethanol preheated separately using heating mantle was added into the reactor. About 2 ml of the reaction mixture was taken immediately using Pasteur pipette and titrated against 0.1 M NaOH solution using phenolphthalein indicator. All the experimental runs were designed by varying the amount of the catalyst, the acid to alcohol mole ratios, and the reaction period to obtain various kinetic parameters while keeping the temperature constant for all the runs. Results: The result revealed that significant improvement on physicochemical characteristics of the bentonite samples occurred as a result of pillaring. The results obtained revealed that the conversion of acetic acid was dependent on the catalyst weight, reaction time and mole ratio. The maximum conversion of acetic acid was obtained for mole ratio (acid: alcohol) of 2:1 with optimum catalyst weight of 2.0g at a reaction temperature of 368K and 90 minutes time on-stream. The pillared clay material was shown to be more active in the conversion of acetic acid than the unpillared counterparts. Kinetics studies revealed that the esterification reaction is second-order and follows the single step Eley- Rideal reaction mechanism. Conclusion: The esterification results showed that the conversion of acetic acid increased as a result of pillaring than the zero and unpillared catalyst. The mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack between adsorbed acetic acid and unadsorbed or competitively adsorbed ethanol to give ethyl-acetate and water. This research has demonstrated that titanium pillared clay has potential for esterification and trans-esterification of carboxylic acids."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:39:34Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Esterification;"},{"subject":"pillarization;"},{"subject":"catalyst;"},{"subject":"kinetics;"},{"subject":"homogenous reaction."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-06-22","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-06-22","titles":[{"title":"The Preparation And Application Of Environmentally Benign Titanium Pillared Clay Catalyst For Esterification Of Ethanol And Acetic Acid"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8288","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:41Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8288","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

In chaotic or turbulent flow field where global mixing occurs, fluid trajectory exponentially expands in particular directions. Consequently, it is quite difficult to visualize streak as a “line” because experimental streak behaves as a “sheet” that has rounded surface. In the present study, to product and visualize a vivid and distinct streakline, a non-ionic surfactant was utilized. Study Design: Experimental study containing simulation. Place and Duration of Study: Division of Chemical Engineering, Department of Materials Engineering Science, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, between December 2010 and October 2011. Methodology: The novel production and visualization technique for vivid streakline in three-dimensional (3D) flow field was developed. The innovative characteristic of visualization technique is that the expansion of streak can be suppressed by the surface tension with the self-assembly of surfactant molecules in the tracer fluid. The impelleragitated tank was adopted as an unsteady 3D flow system. A non-ionic surfactant, \"Emulgen 103 (Kao Co., Ltd., polyoxyethylenelaurylether) was adopted, whose concentration was optimized at about 9 mass% in advance. Results: The obtained streakline could keep the linear form for a long time not to expand, and there was little leakage of colored component due to the effect of molecular diffusion. The streakline could circulate freely in the tank; nevertheless its linear structure was maintained for a long time even if the streakline collided with the tank wall and impeller blades. The periodical consistency of streakline structure could be confirmed, which was one of necessary and sufficient conditions for the movement of streakline with flow field. Conclusion: This study clearly demonstrates the production method of vivid streakline with the help of surfactant. While this technique has a little room for additional refinement, the present technique may be used and developed for future science and practical applications."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:39:51Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Chaotic advection;"},{"subject":"Non-linear Dynamics;"},{"subject":"Streakline;"},{"subject":"Surfactant;"},{"subject":"Self-assembly;"},{"subject":"Visualization."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-06-13","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-06-13","titles":[{"title":"Production And Visualization Of Vivid Streakline With The Self-Assembly Of Surfactant Molecules"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8289","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:42Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8289","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Adsorption capacity of the adsorbent. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Chemistry Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, Nigeria, between April and November 2010. Methodology: Activated carbon was prepared from groundnut shell using two step processes with H2SO4 as an activating agent. Three different activated carbon was produced at different residual time of 5, 10 and 15 minutes which are GS/H2SO4/5 (AC1), GS/H2SO4/10 (AC2) and GS/H2SO4/15 (AC3). Chromium and nickel batch adsorption was carried out at various contact time (30 to 150 minutes). Results: The result indicated the maximum chromium and nickel adsorption at the contact time of 120 minutes and 150 minutes which implies that increase in contact time lead to increase in the adsorption of the heavy metals. Kinetic models including pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order and Elovich model were used to study the adsorption processes. Chromium and nickel adsorption could be best described by the pseudo second-order kinetic model. Conclusion: The study revealed that groundnut shell, a low cost adsorbent can be effectively used as a raw material for the preparation of activated carbon for the adsorption of chromium and nickel from dye effluent."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-03T13:40:27Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Activated carbon;"},{"subject":"adsorption;"},{"subject":"dye effluent;"},{"subject":"groundnut shell;"},{"subject":"pseudo second-."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-03-04","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-03-04","titles":[{"title":"Kinetic Study Of Utilizing Groundnut Shell As An Adsorbent In Removing Chromium And Nickel From Dye Effluent"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8291","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:21:42Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8291","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The effect of two different impression materials on the accuracy of the implant casts was also evaluated for abutment-level impressions. Materials and Methods: A reference model with six internal-connection implant replicas placed in the completely edentulous mandibular arch and connected to multi-base abutments was fabricated from heat-curing acrylic resin. Forty impressions of the reference model were made, 20 each with polyether (PE) and polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) impression materials using the open tray technique. The PE and PVS groups were further subdivided into four subgroups of five each on the bases of splinting type: no splinting, bite registration PE, bite registration addition silicone, or autopolymerizing acrylic resin. The positional accuracy of the implant replica heads was measured on the poured casts using a coordinate measuring machine to assess linear differences in interimplant distances in all three axes. The collected data (linear and three-dimensional [3D] displacement values) were compared with the measurements calculated on the reference resin model and analyzed with nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney). Results: No significant differences were found between the various splinting groups for both PE and PVS impression materials in terms of linear and 3D distortions. However, small but significant differences were found between the two impression materials (PVS, 91 mu m; PE, 103 mu m) in terms of 3D discrepancies, irrespective of the splinting technique employed. Conclusions: Casts obtained from both impression materials exhibited differences from the reference model.

The colony forming units (CFU) after the exposure periods at three different depths &lt;100 mu m, 100-350 pm and 350-500 mu m were enumerated. After 5 min of exposure, both antibiotics had significantly lower CFU count than Ca(OH)(2) solution at three dentinal depths. Comparing with the oxytetracycline, the CFU count of the erythromycin was significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower at the depth of 100-500 pm. Similarly, after 10 min of exposure, erythromycin had significantly lower CFU count (p&lt;0.05) at three dentinal depths. Oxytetracycline showed significantly lower CFU count than Ca(OH)(2) at 100 pm depth. Comparing with the two exposure times, the erythromycin and Ca(OH)(2) groups showed significant lower CFU counts after 10 min of exposure in the antimicrobial agents to 5 min.

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, October 6 university (Medical Unit IV) and Inorganic laboratory, Central laboratory, Greater Cairo Drinking Water Company, Fustat water treatment plant, between June 2012 and Jan. 2013. Methodology: Nile water samples were taken from water intake throughout the fustat plant, treated with different doses of huwa-san and chlorine to evaluate their effect on the levels of water contained from Al, Zn, Cr, Ni, Fe, Pb and Cu. Results: It was found that the treatment with huwa-san more effective than chlorine in decreasing Al, Zn, Cr, Ni and Cu at the most doses. Also, it is more effective than chlorine in decreasing Fe and Pb concentrations at the doses 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ppm while at the dose 7 ppm, the chlorine becomes more effective than huwa-san in decreasing concentration of these elements. Mn showed different results. The chlorine decreased Mn obviously more than huwa-san at all the doses. On the other hand, both of chlorine and huwa-san have the same effect on Zn only at the doses 2 and 3 ppm. The chlorine decreased Ni concentration more than huwa-san at the doses 2 and 3 ppm but huwa-san becomes more effective at the other doses. The results showed that the disinfection with huwa-san more effective results than chlorine at the same doses. 4 ppm of huwa-san represents the most suitable disinfection dose used during the treatment process.

Light microscopy of a transverse section of the leaf of P. longifolia revealed the presence of various plant cells. Phytochemical screening results revealed the presence of alkaloids, triterpenoids, tannins, saponin, anthraquinones, and glycosides in the extract. The concentrations of heavy metals determined in the extract were well below the permissible limit. Nine peaks observed in the HPLC spectra showed the presence of various compounds in the extract. The GCMS method used for quantification of (3 beta,4 alpha,5 alpha,9 beta)-4,14-dimethyl-9,19-cycloergost-24(28)-en-3-yl acetate (i.e., cycloeucalenol acetate) in the extract was rapid, accurate, precise, linear (R-2 = 0.8752), and robust. The HPTLC analysis showed ten specific peaks for the methanolic extract of P. longifolia leaf.

Soils from the two sites were acidic with low to moderate available P for Chepkoilel and Kipsangui sites respectively. Soil pH and soil available P increased with the increase in the rate of lime addition. Wheat grain yield increased significantly (p=0.05) due to soil acidity amendment above the control. There was a high positive correlation between wheat yields and soil available P at both sites at harvest. High cost of inorganic inputs, low wheat grain prices and the effects of the erratic rains made the majority of the treatments economically unviable for adaptation by farmers.

Because of quota system abolition many of the less efficient suppliers will lose quota rents and market shares as they are forced to compete with more efficient suppliers among developing countries. Since 1974, Bangladesh was enjoying a quota free access of garments under the Multi- Fibre Arrangement (MFA). But the phase out of the Multi- Fibre Arrangement (MFA) has completed in 2005 under the Uruguay round of GATT (General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade) in 1994. The freeing of trade in textiles and clothing has created a formidable challenge to the Bangladesh Ready Made Garments (RMG) Industry. The phase-out of the MFA, emergence of competitors such as China, India, Vietnam, Turkey, Mexico and African nations have negatively impacted on the fortunes of Bangladesh RMG sector. Dependence on imported raw materials, political instability, turbulent economy, high bank interest rates, lack of government incentives, poor knowledge of international marketing, port problem, poor infrastructure and labor union are some of the internal problems of Bangladesh RMG. This sector is being incrementally faced with the burden of obligations imposed by the developed countries in the guise of compliance issues. There are two types of views about the future of Bangladesh Ready Made Garments (RMG) Industry after MFA era.

This trend had impacted on small traders in terms of higher cost of doing business, and individual travel behavior over time. Insecurity and travel time constraints had affected the growth of the entrepreneurial environment in most cities in Nigeria. In some regions trade and commerce have experienced very low performance. In most of the Northern Eastern states and big commercial centers in Kano, markets and commercial activities have remained closed due to high security alerts. Aims: To highlight various travel constraints affecting mobility as a result of the growing insecurity on Nigerian roads. Study Design: This study examines some literature on discrete choice and travel-based models. Place and Duration of Study: Contemporary travel constraints in Nigeria from 2000– 2012, and the growing ethno-religious crisis in different parts of the country. Methodology: Review of literature. Results/observations: The working of these models is effective where the choice set is not constrained, and the independent irrelevant alternatives (IIA) may not include options/alternatives with a “lesser evil” definitions. This is because it is restrictive for behavioural choice, (utility may be ranked). In advanced market economies, infrastructure has been a springboard for creating and enhancing trade hubs that promotes trade and commerce. A high Infrastructure gap exists in less developed countries as a result of fiscal policy problems, high population and the process of prioritizing development programs by the political machineries. Conclusion: In a typical developing country like Nigeria – a low middle income country, most literature has been concerned with the lack of productivity of roads: (i) accessibility, the ability to access safe transport in terms of cost and travel time and (ii) connectivity, to be able connect or link up some volatile routes – in terms of security and other adverse road conditions."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T08:33:59Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Discrete choice models;"},{"subject":"travel behavior;"},{"subject":"travel constraints;"},{"subject":"road infrastructure;"},{"subject":"insecurity."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-17","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-17","titles":[{"title":"Discrete Choice Models And Individual Travel Constraints In Nigeria: A Literature Review"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8368","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:19Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8368","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The study employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration. The analysis is carried out using three indicators to measure the level of financial developments which are the ratio of the credit provided to private sector by commercial banks as a percentage of GDP, the ratio of liquid liabilities of commercial banks to nominal GDP and the broad money supply as a percentage of GDP. We also include four control variables in our analysis. These variables are inflation rate, trade openness, gross investment and government expenditures. As financial development indicators concerned, the result of the long run analysis indicates that credit to the private sector and the liquid liabilities exert positive effect while money supply affect real per capita GDP negatively. The credit to the private sector and the liquid liabilities coefficients have expected signs. Although the relation between financial development indicators and real per capita GDP is low and insignificant especially in the case of liquid liabilities and money supply, credit to the private sector is the only indicator that affects the economy in Sudan in the long-run. Although we could not find any short-run relationship between the explanatory variables and real per capita GDP in Sudan, these variables are found to be related in the long-run. The results indicate that government expenditure, inflation, money supply and trade openness exert negative effects, while investment, private credit and liquidity have positive effect on real per capita GDP. These findings may be attributed to the weak capital base of Sudanese banks, the high cost of borrowing due to insufficient inter-bank competition, the risk of extending credit to sectors other than trade, which is considered by banks as unjustifiably high and the absence of an appropriate investment climate required to foster significant private investment and promote growth in the long run."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T08:35:14Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Long run growth;"},{"subject":"financial intermediation;"},{"subject":"bounds testing."}],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-17","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-17","titles":[{"title":"Financial Intermediation And Economic Growth In Sudan: An Empirical Investigation, 1970-2011"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8370","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:19Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8370","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

It considers the various problems the copyright regime presents for archives undertaking mass digitisation projects as well as recent European and UK initiatives in this domain. It argues that the UK copyright regime, even when read in conjunction with current national and regional recommendations for reform, falls short of delivering a legal framework that would enable archivists to realise the full potential that comprehensive, universal online access to the country’s archival holdings would contribute to local and national democracy and accountability, to education, learning, and culture, and to the sense of identity and place for local people, communities and organisations. Ultimately, a case is made for the differential treatment of archives within the copyright regime – different, that is, from libraries and other related institutions operating within the cultural sector.

The key findings are:\n\n\n\tParody is a signifi cant consumer activity: On average, there are 24 user-generated parodies available for each original video of a charting single.\n\tThere is no evidence for economic damage to rights holders through substitution: The presence of parody content is correlated with, and predicts larger audiences for original music videos.\n\tThe potential for reputational harm in the observed sample is limited: Only 1.5% of all parodies sampled took a directly negative stance, discouraging viewers from commercially supporting the original.\n\tObserved creative contributions were considerable: In 78% of all cases, the parodist appeared on camera (also diminishing the possibility of confusion).\n\tThere exists a small but growing market for skilled user-generated parody: Parodists who exhibit higher production values in their works attract larger audiences, which can be monetized via revenue share with YouTube.\n\n\nSecondly, we present a distilled discussion of the legal treatment of parodies in seven jurisdictions that have implemented a copyright exception for parody (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and USA). The underlying principles (including economic and constitutional) governing divergent legal approaches are identified, and a list of policy options is presented.\n\nThirdly, we provide a synthesis of the legal analysis and the empirical data.

Domain names, for example are an obvious example of an economic asset which may be crucial to the branding and thus the profitability of a business. In a family business, not only who inherits the domain name itself, but also who gets the email notifying of the upcoming need to re-register, may be controversial issues. Similarly many outlet businesses nowadays operate exclusively from eBay and, again, who inherits that account (i.e. the password and login), the money attached to the account, and any connected ongoing auctions will be a serious matter. Virtual assets in game worlds often represent the fruit of thousands of hours of labour (if game playing can be called labour[2]) and there is already a substantial ethical and legal literature around their value, sale and conditions for transferability[3]. Photos, blogs and text (e.g. spontaneous poems) within social network profiles by celebrities – or those who die and later become famous – are likely soon to be of economic value, just as author’s letters and unpublished novels[4]are today.\n\nBut such assets may also be of what one might call sentimental value. Millions of photos exist on Flickr, Picasa, etc which are of very little value to anyone but the accountholder’s immediate friends and family – but to them they may be priceless. Similarly, access to the emails of a deceased family member may be of desperate importance to the bereaved, and this issue more than any has sparked public and legislative attention to the issue of digital assets, intermediary platforms and death (see below, sec. B, p. 6). Another crucial modern phenomenon is the trend towards “memorialisation” of social network profiles on Facebook and the like[5]; effectively turning them into shrines to the memory of the deceased, where friends leave last messages and other friends gather to read them. In such cases, although money is not (usually) the issue, emotions can run very high and conflicts develop (do the friends or the parents decide if the profile is memorialised? What if the profile tells people something about the deceased the parents would rather suppress e.g. homosexuality, atheism, suicide?) and the first litigation relating to access to, and possession of, social network profiles is also beginning to percolate through[6].\n\nFinally it is worth noting that society in general as well as specific heirs, family and friends has an interest in the legacy of the dead; e.g. authors’ letters (or emails, or blogs) have value to historians, scholars and critics as well as a market value to collectors. The range of stakeholders involved  in digital assets cases is thus disparate and by no means limited to those in a contractual relationship with service providers[7].\n\nIn all types of cases, the legal issues around access, control, ownership and transmission are complex, and worse still, such answers as there are may vary considerably from legal system to legal system. It is important to note the law does not start here from a blank canvas. To some extent, existing laws will already partially regulate the issues. Almost all legal systems have rules relating to the transmission of property on death, under the name of wills and testaments law, succession, probate etc. Succession law is usually divided into what the law says when a will has been made by the deceased (testacy) and what happens when no will exists (intestacy). The law regulating the procedure to wind up the deceased’s estate – the ingathering and distribution of assets to heirs or legatees – is a separate branch of law again, usually called executry or administration. Unhelpfully, succession laws tend to be very localised -  e.g. the substantive laws relating to transmission of assets on death vary wildly even between, say, the various United States, England and Wales, and Scotland,  which are at least all three common law jurisdictions (though Scotland has considerable civilian influence). Civilian legal systems (eg as found in the nations of Continental Europe, Latin America, Louisiana, Quebec and Japan) differ even further. These differences matter: in one system, the spouse of the deceased may inherit or have the right to occupy the family home no matter what a will says – in others, the will may reign triumphant. In some systems, step-children may inherit nothing on intestacy, while in others they may be equal to full-blood children. Some attempts have been made to harmonise a few aspects of succession law globally – e.g. as discussed below, the laws on recognition of grants of administration obtained abroad in relation to assets in the local jurisdiction – but very little of the basic substantive law has been globally harmonised. As we shall see later, this means difficult jurisdictional problems are likely to arise in the nature of digital assets , for example, if an English person dies in England but with a profile on Facebook, a company whose HQ is in California but whose servers may be distributed globally. We touch briefly on this issue at section E.\n\nThe key question is how far digital assets fit well into these existing legal paradigms, complex as they are, and whether new law is needed. Two preliminary issues complicate the matter. First, in general, assets only fall into the estate of a deceased if they are “<em>property</em>”. Property law, like succession law, is a well-established and ancient branch of private law. It has also been annotated by more modern legal conceptions including intellectual property (IP) law, data protection (DP) law, privacy law and information law. Property is most often recognisable as to what transmits on death. It has restrictions. In most systems, not all things we may want, or think we own, are property, although where the line is drawn is one of the most difficult issues in private law. Some items cannot be owned as they belong to all of us: the air and the high seas are usually in this category. More relevantly to digital assets, some items are too evanescent to be property. The hope of a future gain – e.g. an option to buy future stock, held by an employee when they die – may or may not convert into an item in their probate inventory, depending on the legal system and the exact details. The same may apply to a future right to sue on behalf of the deceased if he or she was libelled or wronged or dismissed from employment without cause during their lifetime. In many legal systems, such claims are viewed as personal to the deceased and title to sue in such cases dies with the wronged person and will not transmit to their heirs.\n\nSome licences – contractual rights to <em>use, </em>as are commonly “sold” in relation to digital music or intellectual property (IP) in general  – are explicitly given only for limited periods of time – which may mean they expire on death (or earlier) and so do not form part of the estate of the deceased. This point is very relevant to inheritance of MP3s downloaded from e.g. iTunes, or e-books downloaded to a Kindle. Finally, some assets are so novel it is simply hard to tell if they can be categorised as property, even if regularly “sold” or valued,  and if so, what kind of property. The “zero day exploits” mentioned above may fall into this character, as might be on-line reputations e.g. the “karma” on Slashdot of a commenter, or a trader’s cumulative rating on eBay. We discuss some of these problems below, using emails and MP3s bought from iTunes as illustrative examples.\n\nThe second key complication is that many important digital assets are controlled, both practically and legally, by <em>intermediaries</em>. This is true in the offline world as well sometimes – e.g. access to a bank account is controlled by the bank when the user dies – but it is much less common than in the online world. Access to Facebook profiles, for example, is entirely controlled by Facebook. A user cannot set up a profile there without entering a contract with Facebook. This contract is usually formed when a user clicks “I accept” or similar, and is therefore deemed to have read and accepted the terms and conditions set by Facebook. (Such agreements – whether known as “end user license agreements” or EULAs (as is common in games and virtual worlds); or terms and conditions (T&amp;C); or Acceptable Use and Privacy Policies are all basically legal contracts.) When the user dies, control of the profile is still effectively with Facebook. They can close or delete or memorialise the profile, according to their own internal rules or norms, while the heirs may not even be able to read it if they are not FB users, or even if they are if they were not “Friends” with the deceased (and how many young people have their mother, say, as a Friend on Facebook?) Legally as far as Facebook is concerned, the relationship between them and the user, even after death, is primarily regulated by contract. The contract may simply not contain any rules on what happens on death – Facebook do give some insight into their internal rules[8] but many service provider contracts are simply blank on the matter, which may mean disputes are left to the discretion of abuse teams, or similar.  Even where rules do exist though, there is a patent potential for conflict on death between the rules of contract and the rules of succession/executry. This major problem was first explored in case law in the celebrated <em>Ellsworth </em>and Yahoo!<em> </em>case, discussed in full below at section B.\n\nA connected and less often aired problem is that contract rules are a matter of private bargaining not social policy. While inheritance laws may have evolved to try to balance the interests of, say, parents and spouse of the deceased, or spouse and best friend, or even society (e.g. <em>ultimus haeres</em> rules) , contract is unlikely to think about the public good or what value society places on family ties. This is particularly true in the context of social network or most online service contracts which are usually (as they say in consumer law) standard form contracts dictated to the user with significant imbalance of power and lack of opportunity to negotiate. In plain English, this mean that users rarely read the contracts they “sign” with online service providers and have no power to alter them even if they did; thus they are likely not to reflect their real wishes on death but merely what is commercially best for the service provider. There is often a lack of transparency as to what the service provider’s rules are, and a lack of consistency as to what the rules are from one service provider to another. This is why it is quite probable that what terms if any social network providers state about transmission of user accounts may well clash with the general law of succession; and that users are likely to have no idea what happens to their profiles etc when they die.\n\nGiven the complexities described above, this chapter will mainly draw comparatively on the laws of the US and England and Wales, with a few references where relevant to EU law. In general as a matter of private law, succession and property laws in the EU are a matter for national law. Some harmonised EU law, e.g. data protection law, is however relevant. Similarly in the US, succession law is largely a state not federal matter.  As already noted, the lack of international (or often even national) harmonisation in this area is a particularly acute problem when talking about “globalised” or delocalised assets such as tweets or Facebook profiles. Another key problem is the simple novelty of the area, meaning there is a lack of legal precedent as well as good practice among solicitors/lawyers.  Part of the plan for future Edwards/Harbinja research is to provide a one-stop shop guide for users and lawyers seeking guidance on devolution of particular digital assets on death.\n\n[1] Edwards L <em>Law and the Internet</em> (3rd edn, Hart, 2009), ch 21, pp 687-690.\n\n[2] Playing games as piecework to create commercially transferable assets (or levels of play) is often called gold-farming, and usually done by developing world players on low wages to sell to time-poor developed world players.

It aims to offer a clearer understanding of how orphan works are regulated and priced in other jurisdictions, and how a pricing system could be structured to ensure that “parents” are fairly remunerated if they re-appear, and users are incentivised to access and exploit registered orphan works.\n\n<strong>Executive Summary</strong>\n\n‘Orphan works’ are works in which copyright still subsists, but where the rightholder, whether it be the creator of the work or successor in title, cannot be located.\n\nThis report was commissioned to assist the UK government in evaluating policy options in the implementation of the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property &amp; Growth (2011) to enable and price the use of orphan works.\n\nThe research proceeded in two stages. Study I undertook a comparative international review of actual or proposed orphan works legislation, and identified key characteristics of orphan works licensing schemes. Study II investigated the potential effects of such schemes by conducting a simulated rights clearance exercise for six scenarios (establishing licence terms and fees for specific commercial and non-commercial uses), and analysing the resulting dataset for effects of the characteristics identified in Study I.\n\nI. Comparative Review\n\nThe comparative review relied on a close scrutiny of actual or proposed legislation and considered government reports, draft bills, publications and other commentaries on the orphan works issue. The countries reviewed included jurisdictions with operational orphan works regulations: Canada, Denmark, Hungary, India, and Japan; as well as provisions at the EU level and in the US (draft legislation and current practice). The purpose of the review was to identify key features of legal regimes with respect to factors such as – (i) categories of works covered; (ii) standards of diligent search; (iii) the mechanism for obtaining permission; (iv) the existence of a register or database of recording suspected orphan works; (v) the role of collecting societies;(vi) tariffs set by category of work; (vii) mechanisms for challenging tariffs; (viii) remedies for reappearing authors and case law, if any, on damages for infringing use.\n\nFindings Study I:\n\n(1) Two distinct approaches appear to be used for governing orphan works in the jurisdictions reviewed. The first may be labelled ‘ex-ante’, and involves rights clearing before a work is used, the second is ‘ex-post’ and typically involves the management of infringement risks by the user.\n\nIn the former an applicant is required to engage with an authorising body or collecting society in order to receive a licence to make use of an orphan work. In contrast, the latter involves either the creation of a statutory copyright exception, or a limitation of liability where an applicant makes use of an orphan work after having exerted some effort to identify the potential rightholder (e.g. diligent search, attribution). These regimes provide different levels of protection for authors and users.\n\nThe ex-ante approach is exemplified by Canada, Japan and India where a potential user has to discuss terms with a copyright board. In ex-post systems payment is only due in case an author reappears. This approach is exemplified by the US. The analysis shows a strong protection for rightholders, both ex ante and ex post, in India, and Japan; and a relatively lower protection in the US, and to a certain extent Denmark (under the system of Extended Collective Licensing). Canada and Hungary are intermediate cases (e.g. no advertising requirements prior to use, but public listing of granted licences).\n\n(2) While most jurisdictions require a diligent search to be conducted by the applicant there is no uniform standard constituting a diligent search. Across jurisdictions the specifications for diligent search vary considerably. Requirements involving the preventive search of the author range from the weak provisions of Denmark (no search required), Canada (requiring “reasonable effort”), and the US (“reasonable search” required) to the strong provisions of India, Japan, Hungary and the EU (but not France) providing a duty for the user of performing a “diligent search” or “due diligence search” (India) accompanied by some form of record tracking of the steps performed. The EU lists minimum sources for a diligent search in the Annex to the Orphan Works Directive. Advertising requirements (in the national press or equivalent) are provided in Japan and India.\n\n(3) The United States had proposed a “limited liability” approach, under which the use of orphan works is possible after a reasonable search. In the case of an infringement claim orphan users are liable only for a reasonable compensation. Denmark uses an Extended Collective Licensing system, which involves collective negotiation with users (normally for multiple licensing) valid also for non-represented authors. In turn, the EU leaves Member States free to choose their regulatory approach (for example, France has chosen a central licensing system in its forthcoming legislation). All the other countries reviewed implement the central licensing system, with a central public authority granting copyright licences on orphan works.\n\n(4) Prices are set by central authorities in the countries that have a central licensing system, and by collecting societies in Denmark. Interestingly, national central authorities have claimed that although no official negotiation process is provided by law, the price of licences is set on a case by case basis, after considering the individual circumstances of the applicant. Set prices can be challenged mostly in an ordinary court of law in the examined countries, or alternatively before the licensing authority with a quasi-judicial procedure (e.g. Canada). Infringement claims are handled by ordinary courts in all countries (including the US) or by licensing authorities with quasi-judicial procedures (in Hungary). In Denmark, both prices and infringement claims are under the jurisdiction of a special tribunal (the Copyright Licensing Tribunal). The above rules on price, infringement, and legal remedies do not derive from EU law, which leaves these matters to Member States.\n\n(5) In Canada, Japan, India, Denmark and France an upfront payment is normally required byte applicant in exchange for using orphan works. In Canada, payment is upfront in approximately two-thirds of cases, whilst it is contingent on the rightholder reappearing in the remaining third. See De Beer and Bouchard (2010). In Hungary the amount is identified but may not be deposited (for non-profit licensees). It will be paid directly to the rightholder, in the event that he or she reappears. In the US, no payment is made until a court decision is issued, following an infringement claim.\n\nParticular roles are envisaged for collecting societies in Denmark, in which they handle the whole system, Hungary, where collecting societies retain unclaimed revenues after five years from expiry of licence, and Canada, where collecting societies are consulted during tariff setting, and hold collected fees (to be used as they see fit).\n\n(6) In the US, in Hungary, and France a voluntary public online register for suspected orphan works is established. The EU is establishing a register at the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM). In Japan, some institutions have their own register of orphan works. No register is envisaged in India, Canada or Denmark (prior to the Orphan Works Directive). However details of all licences granted are available on-line in Canada.\n\nII. Rights Clearance Simulation\n\nThe “Rights Clearance Exercise” reported in Study II is a combination of various methods. In a first step a simulation approach is employed to collect a unique dataset on actual or potential licence fees for orphan works. Representatives of rights clearance authorities from countries covered in the comparative legal review (Canada, Denmark, France, Hungary, India, Japan, supplemented by some US data) were asked to provide a licence fee for each of six scenarios that are likely to occur in reality (from creating a small online resource to mass digitisation projects).\n\nThe identification of the various scenarios was the outcome of a rigorous methodological procedure. The six identified scenarios were:\n\n\n\tHistorical geographic maps for a video game for mobile phones (up to 50 maps\n\tA vintage postcard collection for web publication and eventual sale of prints (up to50 cards)\n\tNational folk tune recordings for multimedia/teaching (DVD) (up to 50)\n\tRe-issuing a 1960/70s TV series as part of a digital on-demand service (one series)\n\tMass digitisation of photographs (archives) by a public non-profit institution, with possible sale of prints (above 100,000 items)\n\tMass digitisation of books by a private for-profit institution, with possible sale of books (above 100,000 items)\n\n\nTwo rates for each scenario were sought, for commercial and non-commercial use. In a second step the dataset is subjected to various analytical techniques, including a regression approach and a comparison of collective licensing systems against others through the computation of effect sizes.\n\nFindings Study II:\n\n(1) There does not appear to be a standard price for licensing orphan works. In fact tariffs vary widely. For example, to clear 50 items from a folk tune archive for commercial use will cost the equivalent of £188 per year in Canada, and (under reasonable assumptions) £9,312 per year in France. In fact, the only consistent finding appears to be that in almost all cases commercial licence fees tend to exceed non-commercial ones.\n\n(2) Licences were not available for all scenarios. Re-issuing orphaned broadcasts seems particularly problematic, with no licence offered in any of the countries investigated.\n\n(3) There is no systematic recognition of what may constitute an appropriate duration for licences. Licences were very variable from country to country, ranging from a monthly to a five-year licence, without the provision of a permanent licence.\n\n(4) We find high tariffs that discourage mass digitisation projects. Per item fees initially appearing very low and thus sustainable turn out to render mass-digitisation unviable for public and non-profit institutions when scaled up under reasonable assumptions. Mass digitisation projects involving 100,000 items may incur annual licensing fees exceeding £1 million per year.\n\n(5) The average level of fees imposed on a potential user of an orphan work is similar in collective and individual licensing regimes. This is an interesting finding because it mitigates arguments that one of the regimes will lead to higher fees. The operating costs involved in running an orphan works scheme appear therefore an important factor when choosing between individual and collective approaches.\n\n(6) A limited liability system seems to have advantages for archives and other non-profit institutions exposed to orphan works, enabling those organisations to share their stock of orphaned artefacts with the public. In contrast, the up-front rights clearing seems to provide more appropriate incentives for commercial uses of orphaned artefacts, guaranteeing that a reappearing rightholder will be compensated for the exploitation of any work.\n\nTogether, the findings from both studies indicate the need for a more structured and consistent approach in governing orphan works that is reflected in the pricing and duration of licences, and in the costs of running any licensing system."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Working paper"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T11:46:14Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[],"dates":[{"date":"2013-07-03","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-07-03","titles":[{"title":"Copyright, And The Regulation Of Orphan Works: A Comparative Review Of Seven Jurisdictions And A Rights Clearance Simulation"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8377","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:21Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8377","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Article 2 of Brussels I Regulation allows for the separate prosecution of every defendant in the country where he or she resides. Although Article 5(3) provides for an alternative solution, the standard scenario involves a multitude of claims submitted country by country, apparently as a logical consequence of the territoriality principle.[1]\n\nIntellectual Property has been the object of considerable harmonization over the years, on the basis of both international treaties and European Union law. Without going too much into details, it is obvious that the combination of territorial (national) intellectual property rights and their exploitation beyond national boundaries raises questions related with the possible application of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation. A <em>forum connexitatis</em> offers in fact the possibility to pursue the infringement of what, from a commercial point of view, is often considered as a single right, rather than a bundle of parallel national intellectual property rights. Thus, the patent infringement performed in a uniform manner, for example by the commercialization of a copy of the patented product by related defendants, is pursued as an single case before a single court. Article 6(1) offers therefore an interesting opportunity in a number of intellectual property cases. However, Article 6(1) is principally targeted at defendants residing in different Member States acting with a common agenda,[2] and this is in contrast with the most common scenario of intellectual property rights infringement, which involves both parallel rights and defendants that act (individually) in a parallel fashion, whether or not they act within a group of companies.\n\nHopes that the recent reform of the Brussels I Regulation would bring clarification on this point, since the existing jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice was not generally supported by intellectual property doctrine and practitioners, have unfortunately not been fulfilled. Except for the fact that the concerned defendant is now expressly defined, nothing changes in the existing text of the Article 6(1) which now becomes Article 8(1).[3] Legal practice must therefore continue to work with the following text of the new Article 8 (the new fragment is within parenthesis):\n\n‘[A person domiciled in a Member State] may also be sued:<br>\n1. where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings;<br>\n2.[...]‘\n\nDebating the causes of this <em>status quo</em> is not very useful for the legal practice. Whether it is an absence of consensus on a modified text or a confirmation of the Court’s interpretation of Article 6(1) is of limited interest. Legal practice must in fact continue working with the existing jurisprudence of the Court.[4] This contribution attempts therefore to clarify the Court’s current position.\n\n[1]        See J.J.

Writing about visual work without reproducing that work is an impoverished exercise, for both writer and reader. But, reproducing visual material can trigger concerns on the part of the conscientious author or – more often – demands on the part of the publisher about the need to secure copyright permission. In this respect, comics scholarship is no different from any other field of visual or cultural studies. Clearing rights for publication can be frustrating and time-consuming, and academic publishers often manage the business of copyright clearance by making their authors responsible for securing permissions. European Comic Art provides a good example. When an article is accepted for publication, authors are ‘required to submit copyright agreements and all necessary permission letters for reprinting or modifying copyrighted materials, both textual and graphic’, and are ‘responsible for obtaining all permissions and clearing any associated fees.’\n\nNot all publishers, however, adhere to such a black and white position. The Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics is published by Taylor &amp; Francis. In the ‘Authors Services’ section of their website, the publisher acknowledges that reproducing short extracts of text and other types of material ‘for the purposes of criticism may be possible without formal permission’.\n\nTo better understand when permission is needed, the publisher directs its authors to the Publishers Association’s Permissions Guidelines. To better understand what rights need to be cleared, authors are directed to the publisher’s own FAQs about using third-party material in an academic article. Thirteen of the publisher’s FAQs expressly relate to the reproduction of visual material, and of those only two concede the possibility of reproducing work without permission (they relate to, respectively, the use of ‘screenshots or grabs of film or video’ and the use of ‘very old paintings’).\n\nWhat is not clear from the FAQs document is whether the publisher is purporting to accurately represent the law in this area. If so – as we shall see – the FAQs document is clearly deficient. If, however, Taylor &amp; Francis is simply using the FAQs document to set out the parameters of its own editorial policy on the reproduction of copyright-protected third-party material, then so be it: the publisher is perfectly entitled to adopt such editorial guidelines as it sees fit. I would suggest, though, that in cleaving to an editorial policy that fails to take full advantage of the scope which the copyright regime allows for the lawful reproduction of copyright-protected material without need for permission, the publisher is missing an opportunity to enable and encourage its contributors to augment and enrich comics scholarship as a discipline.\n\nIt is in this respect that The Comics Grid is more ambitious and forward-thinking: it actively promotes the lawful use of copyright-protected content for the purposes of academic scholarship. The journal’s copyright policy sets out that third-party images are reproduced on the basis of ‘educational fair use’, with readers and contributors directed to Columbia University Libraries’ Fair Use Checklist for further information. This is a checklist that has been developed to help academics and other scholars make a reasonable and balanced determination about whether their use of copyright-protected work is permissible under s.107 of the US Copyright Act 1976: the fair use provision.\n\nObviously, The Comics Grid locates its copyright advice within the context of US copyright law. But, as a Glasgow-based academic, with an interest in both the history and the current state of the UK copyright regime, my particular focus within this comic concerns the extent to which academics – or indeed anyone interested in writing about comics – can rely upon UK copyright law to reproduce extracts and excerpts from published comics and graphic novels without having to ask the copyright owner for permission. To address that issue we must consider three key questions. What constitutes ‘a work’ protected by copyright within the context of comics publishing? What does it mean to speak of ‘insubstantial copying’ from a copyright-protected comic? And what can be copied lawfully from a comic for the purpose of criticism and review?"}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"RPRT","resourceType":"Working paper"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T11:50:23Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[],"dates":[{"date":"2013-11-29","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2013-11-29","titles":[{"title":"Writing About Comics And Copyright"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8379","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2013,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:21Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8379","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

This was further extended by a review of available literature on the digitisation of archival and library collections for publication online, contextualized with specific examples.\n\nExisting literature reveals that rights clearance procedures impose prohibitive burdens on cultural institutions, through the cost of staff time and training in both diligent search and the process of contacting rightsholders.[3] It also indicates that in most cases, the results of rights clearance processes are unsatisfactory: either copyright holders cannot be identified and traced; or those who are contacted, do not respond to permission requests. Archives, in contrast to libraries, have the added complication of dealing with larger and more varied collections of material, the majority of which has been created for non-commercial purposes; this material is often unpublished at the point of deposit with the archive, and typically includes higher proportions of orphan works (when compared with traditional library collections).[4]\n\nDocumented examples of archival rights clearance projects are scarce, and where studies do exist, they have generally been conducted at a large-scale level, and do not contain sufficient detail to enable in-depth analysis of the rights clearance process.[5] Anna Vuopala’s excellent Orphan Works study[6] includes examples of rights clearance projects at 19 institutions, and focuses almost exclusively on the time and cost required to clear rights, which is extremely useful, but leaves out other valuable details about the right clearance process: for example, the number of rightsholders’ contact details found; the refusal rates and reasons given for refusal at each institution; and the number of rightsholders who do not respond to permission requests.\n\nIn general, there is a lack of detailed evidence concerning rights clearance in archival digitisation, and especially in relation to projects that employ risk-management strategies in a sector which is known to be highly risk averse. The WL was chosen as an appropriate subject for this case study given the scale of their digitisation aims, and their use of a risk managed approach to copyright compliance.\n\nCodebreakers, as a digitisation project, was never designed to facilitate a study of the process of rights clearance – by the time data collection for the Copyright and Risk Project began, Codebreakers was entering its final stages, with the official launch of the project website taking place in February 2013. As a result, semi-structured interviews were chosen as the most effective method of obtaining data about the project. Interviews were conducted with key project staff at the WL as well as with staff from five partner archives involved in delivering the Codebreakers project.\n\nThe semi-structured format of the interviews was chosen for its flexibility; a list of questions was chosen, but given the length of the interviews, it was possible to divert from these questions and follow up on unexpected lines of enquiry raised by the interview subjects. Also, by working from a set list of questions, it was still possible to collate the answers to specific questions, thereby producing some quantifiable data. The questions were generated through a discussion of the aims of the project, and through consultation of other similar projects: specifically Jean Dryden’s doctoral research on the practices of Canadian repositories when making their archival material available online.[7]\n\nThe interviews covered five specific areas: the respondents’ role within their place of work; their role working on the Codebreakers project; the rights clearance challenges posed by the project; the development of policies and practices over the timeframe of the project; and finally, the respondents’ own views and experience of copyright, divorced from an institutional perspective.\n\nUsing this method of enquiry, respondents were asked about policies and practices mandated by the institutions they work for, but also for their own opinions as professionals, built up though work experience, education and training. By encouraging the respondents to reflect on their own experience, it was also possible to use the ‘snowball’ technique to tease out pointers to documentation and other resources used by the respondents, not only in relation to this project, but to their experience working on others as well.\n\nOnce completed, the interviews were transcribed to provide usable data. The transcriptions were used for a variety of purposes. Responses to specific questions were logged to give quantifiable results. Where respondents gave specific examples of practices, or policy changes, these are used as evidence in the text of this report. As a result of interviewing respondents at the Wellcome, project documentation was also made available for inclusion in this case study. This material takes two forms: policy documents which were circulated and updated as the project took place; and an internal report produced towards the end of the project, which includes a variety of statistics and more general lessons learned. The documentation has been discussed in the text of the report and examples of specific documents are available in the Appendix.\n\nThis combination of anecdotal evidence, combined with results and project documentation, has allowed us to trace the processes by which the WL has used risk management to achieve their digitisation objectives.\n\n \n\n[1] The Wellcome Library Collection Development Policy is available athttp://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/collection-development-policy.pdf [Accessed: 5 Dec 2013]\n\n[2] Deazley, R., and Stobo, V.

Up to a decade ago exhaustion in copyright was strictly limited to the distribution of (multiple) hard copies of copyright works. Anything else was considered to be outside the exhaustion rules. E.g. multiple showings of a movie in movie theatres was seen as the essence of movie copyright and exhaustion had therefore no role to play in that area according to the <em>Coditel</em>decision. [1] How wrong were we though when we assumed that the digital revolution that turned so many things upside down in copyright would have no impact in this area.\n\nAdmittedly, the decoder cases [2] were potentially only about hard copies. Hard copies in the sense of cards for decoders for satellite broadcasts of football matches could easily be subjected to the exhaustion rules that enforce the free movement of goods provisions of the EU Treaty. But if the decoder cards that had been obtained in Greece could be used in the UK, such use gave access to the broadcasts. The real impetus to accept this and to breach the uncontested logic of the <em>Coditel</em> approach may have been in competition law in the decoder cases, but they show clearly that the logic of copyright is not the dominant factor in the digital era. [3] That dominance is on the basis of the EU Treaty given to the rules on free movement and on competition law.\n\n<em>Usedsoft </em>[4] clearly fits in with that evolution. The <em>Usedsoft v Oracle</em> case [5] was all about computer software wich Oracle develops and markets. Oracle is the proprietor of the exclusive user rights under copyright law in those programs. It distributes the software at issue in 85% of cases by downloading from the internet. The customer downloads a copy of the software directly to his computer from Oracle’s website. The user right for such a program, which is granted by a licence agreement, includes the right to store a copy of the program permanently on a server and to allow a certain number of users to access it by downloading it to the main memory of their work-station computers. UsedSoft markets used software licences, including user licences for Oracle computer programs. For that purpose UsedSoft acquires from customers of Oracle such user licences, or parts of them, where the original licences relate to a greater number of users than required by the first acquirer. Usedsoft’s practices involve the making of a copy of the computer program, which raises the question of the infringement of the right of reproduction. A further question that arises is whether the right to distribute a copy of the computer program is exhausted. A positive answer to the question may help to justify Usedsoft’s business model.\n\nAnd effectively, in the CJEU’s judgment one see the application of exhaustion rules, despite the absence of a sale of hard copies. But the special rules that are contained in the software Directive are, for fairly obvious reasons, rather omnipresent in the decision. Could it therefore be that <em>Usedsoft</em> is entirely software specific [6] and that even in that context a small change to existing business practices can overcome the impact of the decision? Or is this only a first example of the exhaustion logic to come and will the Court of Justice of the European Union apply the same logic to other copyright works? On-line distribution of music and licences granting access to on-line databases are then obvious candidates that attract attention. In essence I am asked whether I have a crystal ball and whether I can gaze in it. The straightforward answer is that I do not have a crystal ball.

The public domain is a subject of vital interest to legal scholars, but its implications are far reaching – indeed, the public domain concept is germane to subjects as diverse as film and media studies, economics, political science and organisational theory. It was a central purpose of the workshop to arrive at a workable definition of the public domain suitable for empirical investigation. The traditional definition (1) takes the copyright term as the starting point, and defines the public domain as “out of copyright”, i.e. all uses of a copyright work are possible.  A second, more fine-grained definition (2) still relies on the statutory provisions of copyright law, and asks what activities are possible with respect to a copyright work without asking for permission (e.g. because use is related to “underlying ideas” not appropriating substantial expressions, or because use is covered by specific copyright exceptions). A third definition (3) includes as part of the public domain all uses that are possible under permissive private ordering schemes (such as creative commons licences).  A forth definition (4) moves into a space that includes use that would formally be copyright infringement but is endorsed, or at least tolerated by certain communities of practice (e.g. machinima or fan fiction).\n\nThe conference was designed to test these definitional approaches, and national and international speakers from relevant disciplinary fields were invited to share their research projects, with a particular focus on the underlying concept of the public domain.

We used key informant and semistructured interviews, focus group discussions and field observations for data collection. Historical analyses of the present and past cropping systems indicated that over the past forty years, there has been a shift from cocoa based to maize based cropping system. The shift in the cropping system was prompted by decline in the yield of cocoa and the difficulty in establishing new cocoa farms as a result of changing rainfall pattern, frequent bushfires and increase in the dry season. Other factors attributed to the shift by farmers included land tenure, soil fertility decline and vegetation change. Strategies being used by farmers to adapt to the changing climate and variability include planting of drought tolerant crops such as cassava, yam and maize and adjusting planting dates of crops to coincide with the onset of the rains. The study indicates that future shift in cropping system from maize to cocoa-based system is unlikely due to deforestation activities and the prevailing climatic conditions."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"Book","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"book","bibtex":"book","ris":"BOOK","resourceType":"Book"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T13:37:29Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Adaptation;"},{"subject":"bushfire;"},{"subject":"deforestation;"},{"subject":"\\land tenure;"},{"subject":"rainfall;"},{"subject":"soil fertility decline;"},{"subject":"vegetation."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-06-06","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-06-06","titles":[{"title":"Climate Change And Shift In Cropping System: From Cocoa To Maize Based Cropping System In Wenchi Area Of Ghana"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8385","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:21Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8385","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Application of 1g/kg EDTA did not adversely affect plant growth, except at preflowering stage where were yellowing of leaves. The concentration of heavy metals in tissues of plant were higher in the experiment than control, with concentration of Pb (376.0, 350.0, 355.2 and 328 mg/kg; experiment, 184.0, 180.0, 169.0 and 159.0 mg/kg; control), Cu ( 962.0, 958.0, 898.0 and 818.0; experiment, 650.0, 526.0 464.2 and442.0 mg/kg; control) and Cd (416.8, 418.2, 399.0 and 377.5; experiment, 167.3, 164.2, 147.8 and 142.2 mg/kg) at Aba Egbira, Atikankan, Igbehin and Moshood street dumpsites respectively in the shoot of the plant. Highest concentrations of heavy metals were obtained in leaves of the plant. Notably, concentration of Pb, Cu and Cd were greater than the threshold value of 100mg/kg, indicative of the fact that J. gossypifolia could be a good candidate for Pb, Cu and Cd-phytoextraction. Bioaccumulation factor (BF), translocation factor (TF) and remediation ratio (RR) values greater than one also revealed the effectiveness of the plant to translocate Pb, Cu and Cd to their harvestable portion and phytoextraction efficiency under the chelant-assisted phytoremediation. However, the concentration of heavy metals did not vary significantly at p&lt;0.05, least significant difference (LSD test) in all dumpsites investigated. Therefore, the use of J. gossypifolia is advocated as a candidate plant for restoring dumpsites polluted with heavy metals."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T13:38:07Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Phytoremediation;"},{"subject":"alocasia;"},{"subject":"dumpsites;"},{"subject":"lead;"},{"subject":"copper accumulation."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-06-27","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-06-27","titles":[{"title":"The Role Of Edta On Heavy Metals Phytoextraction By Jatropha Gossypifolia Grown On Soil Collected From Dumpsites In Ekiti State Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8386","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8386","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Study Site and Duration: Survey and observational sites were located in 1) Gannan Arboretum and 2) Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, China. The survey and observations of introduced tree species were conducted from October, 2009, to November, 2010. Additional growth records were obtained for a period prior to and including the 1970s to assist in the investigation. Methodology: 1) The meteorological data (1951–2009) record was used to analyse climatic change patterns. 2) Growth and development of introduced tree species were examined to evaluate effects of introduction. 3) Climate zone attributes of introduced tree species were determined in order to establish place of origin. Effects of introduced tree species were coupled with climatic change scenario data to analyze associative relationships. Results: 1) A trend in climate warming has been evident in Ganzhou City since the1950s. Based on metrological records from 1951 to 2009, a steady rise in annual average temperature has occurred in the region, increasing from 0.2ºC to 0.3ºC each 20 year period. This trend has been especially evident by changes to average temperature during the coldest month (January) as well as changes in annual minimum temperatures. 2) According to observations and measurements, 39 introduced tropical tree species have successfully established themselves in the Ganzhou region through natural domestication. Among these, 24 tree species were considered basically successful with normal growth patterns while the remaining 15 species achieved preliminary success. 3) Stem analysis data on the five primary introduced tree species indicate that growth patterns were normal and vigorous, suggesting that these tropical tree species have successfully established themselves. It was therefore determined that the successful northward migration of the 39 tree species investigated was chiefly the result of a climate warming trend taking place in the region."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T13:38:50Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Climate change;"},{"subject":"introduction;"},{"subject":"Ganzhou;"},{"subject":"tropical tree species;"},{"subject":"southern subtropical tree species."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-06-28","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-06-28","titles":[{"title":"Climate Change Effects On Southern Subtropical And Tropical Tree Species In Ganzhou City, China"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8387","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8387","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

An increase of 880 TWh of electricity consumption in transport in 2030 compared with the Reference Scenario, of which 90% occurs in PLDVs, results in about 250 Mt of additional CO2 emissions. The rise in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is 1.0 – 3.50C (1PCC, 2007a). If emissions of greenhouse gases, and in particular CO2, continue unabated the enhanced greenhouse effect may alter the world’s climate system irreversibly. This review attempted to examine how climate change constitutes a threat to food security and environmental conservation. Climate change (CC) refers to changes in modern climate. It reflects abnormal variations to the expected climate within the earth’s atmosphere and subsequent effects on other parts of the earth. It is emphasized that CC poses a threat to food security as it impacts on natural systems and resources through erratic rainfall patterns, heightened temperature and susceptibility to pest and disease outbreaks hence decreasing crop yields and consequently increased hunger. CC negatively affects biodiversity conservation and management through exacerbated drought conditions, increased risk of wildfires leading to some extreme events like heat, waves, river and coastal flooding, landslides, storms, hurricanes and tornadoes which culminate in environmental degradation. For its effects to be reduced establishment of more forest plantations and maintenance of the existing natural and artificial forests should be encouraged. Saving biodiversity in the form of standing forests and interact lands can help prevent climate change and help communities and natural areas cope with a changing planet. At the same time, helping nature become more reification climate change through a combination of management restoration and protection strategies will help prepare places, plants, animals and people for climatic change successful adoption of living system can help ensure their ability to support the needs of people and better withstand future changes."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T13:40:43Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Climate change;"},{"subject":"greenhouse gas;"},{"subject":"food security;"},{"subject":"biodiversity decimation;"},{"subject":"environmental degradation;"}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-06-27","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-06-27","titles":[{"title":"Global Climate Change: A Threat To Food Security And Environmental Conservation"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8390","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8390","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Samples were transferred to the laboratory in iced coolers and analyzed using Gas chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The interactions of the PAH components detected was determined using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r) while spatial variance equality in means of concentrations was explored with the One-way ANOVA. Structure detection of observed inequalities was made with means plots. Concentrations of the PAHs were high and exceeded the WHO maximum permissible limit of 0.002mg/l in drinking water. Benzo(b)fluoranthene, with the highest mean concentration varied between 0.00037- 0.51266 (0.08117±0.03330159)mg/l, fluoranthene varied between 0.00060-0.32890 (0.0473946±0.01769877)mg/l, while benzo(k)fluoranthene with the least mean concentration varied between 0.00017-0.08478 (0.0237385±0.00610045)mg/l.

Significant heterogeneity in mean variance of the PAHs [F(211.9502)&gt;Fcrit(3.921478)] was recorded across the sampling locations at P&lt;0.05. Structure detection of mean difference revealed that the inequalities were most contributed in BH1, BH 2, BH 5 and BH 10, while equality in mean concentrations were observed between BH 1 and BH 4, and BH 5 and BH 6. BH 8 recorded the highest contamination level of the various PAHs due basically to its proximity to the refinery’s effluent channel. The most probable source of these PAHs is therefore the nearby Port Harcourt Refinery Company’s effluent discharges into the surrounding creeks of the mainland.

The study found that the horticulturists were nearly males (93.7%), young adults (54.0%), earning about three dollars per day (63.6%), have been in practice for more than four years (79.3%) and altogether using about 1.5% of land in the study area for SHG.

The horticulturists’ Motivating Index (HMI) employed to know why they went into the practice revealed that they (51%) were moved by the depreciating state of urban green (HMI=2.55) and feared (46.4%) the impending ecological doom on the built environment due to lack of sufficient green space, causing global warming (HMI=2.32). This could be why the linear regression test of the preference of social to economic value of the practice of SHG in the study area has its R2 to be 0.219. This means that SHG in the area did not necessarily bring positive economic value to the horticulturists as the social value embedded in it.

This article discusses the potential for such integrated systems in the stationary and portable power market in response to the critical need for a cleaner energy technology. Throughout the theme several issues relating to renewable energies, environment, and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. It is concluded that green energies like wind, solar, groundsource heat pumps, and biomass must be promoted, implemented, and demonstrated from the economic and/or environmental point view. Study design: Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impacts (acid precipitation, ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect or global warming) are comprehensively discussed in this article. Place and Duration of Study: National Centre for Research, Energy Research Institute (ERI), between January 2011 and July 2011. Methodology: An approach is needed to integrate renewable energies in a way to meet high building performance. However, because renewable energy sources are stochastic and geographically diffuse, their ability to match demand is determined by adoption of one of the following two approaches: the utilisation of a capture area greater than that occupied by the community to be supplied, or the reduction of the community’s energy demands to a level commensurate with the locally available renewable resources. Results: The adoption of green or sustainable approaches to the way in which society is run is seen as an important strategy in finding a solution to the energy problem. The key factors to reducing and controlling CO2, which is the major contributor to global warming, are the use of alternative approaches to energy generation and the exploration of how these alternatives are used today and may be used in the future as green energy sources. Conclusion: This global warming will eventually lead to substantial changes in the world’s climate, which will, in turn, have a major impact on human life and the built environment. Therefore, effort has to be made to reduce fossil energy use and to promote green energies, particularly in the building sector. Energy use reductions can be achieved by minimising the energy demand, by rational energy use, by recovering heat and the use of more green energies."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T13:42:36Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Renewable energy;"},{"subject":"environment;"},{"subject":"sustainable development;"},{"subject":"global warming."}],"dates":[{"date":"2011-07-31","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2011-07-31","titles":[{"title":"Energy And Environment: Applications And Sustainable Development"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8393","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2011,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:22Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8393","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

Termites are also amongst the most difficult insects to study because of their cryptic behaviour and natural nesting habitat.

Termite identification is crucial to understanding termite distribution and their relationship to climate change. Some termite species are well known pests of agricultural crops, forest trees, wood products and timber-in-service causing considerable damage in Africa. This review paper attempts to collate information on African termite distribution and climate change and highlights some knowledge gaps. Africa is the origin of the termite family of Macrotermitinae. The paper focuses more on economically important termite species in Africa. The use of traditional identification methods coupled with molecular techniques in resolving some of the challenges in termite distribution with particular reference to climate change in Africa are discussed. There is scant information on published literature on the impact of climate change on termites with particular reference to termite distribution in Africa.

Methodology: The data used for this analysis was essentially time series data for all the variables spanning the period 1961-2000. It uses regression analysis to determine the most important of these variables that affects CO2 emissions and uses correlation analysis and coefficient of determination to verify the nature of the interactions between the variables. Results: The results show that as forest area reduces there is an increase in CO2 emissions concentration in the air in Cameroon. On the other hand, as forest area and rainfall reduce arable production also reduces but forest area is seen to be more responsible for changes in arable production than rainfall. Conclusion: The study concludes that the interactions between CO2 and forest area, arable production and forest area seem to be the most significant while rainfall is denoted as very variable from year to year."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T13:49:51Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Forest area;"},{"subject":"CO2 emissions;"},{"subject":"rainfall;"},{"subject":"arable production."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-02-29","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-02-29","titles":[{"title":"The Environmental Quadrupole: Forest Area, Rainfall, Co2 Emissions And Arable Production Interactions In Cameroon"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8400","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:23Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8400","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}

The distilleries are heated on open fires fed by crude oil that is tipped into pits in the ground. As part of the oil burns away, some seeps into the ground. The waste from the process is stored in open pits thereby increasing the risk of the contamination of the environment and possibly impacting the underground aquifer. It is this concern of crude oil seeping to the groundwater that necessitated the current investigation with the sole objective of assessing the vulnerability of the aquifer to the activities of artisanal refining. Soil, water and crude oil samples from artisanal refining sites were collected according to standard procedures and transferred to the laboratory for analyses to determine their properties. An empirical method was adopted in estimating the permeability. The Kozeny – Carman equation for deriving the coefficient of permeability takes the porosity (η) into account. Using a typical soil porosity η = 0.4, mean particle size = 0.05 and mean viscosity determined from crude samples permeability estimate was calculated to be 3.6 x 10- 8cm/s, infiltration was assessed using a simplified version of Darcy’s law. With a typical superficial soil permeability of 3.6 x 10-8 cm/s, depth of ponding of 0.5m, and a wetting front of 0.4m, an estimated infiltration rate of 1.15 x 10-8cm/s can be expected. Given the infiltration rate and the depth to groundwater (water table is between 3m and 8m), we calculated the time for crude oil contaminant plume to intercept the water table simply reexpressing the equation for velocity as distance/time which results in approximately 4.6 years. The character of the water from the area indicates that groundwater is already being impacted given that artisanal refining has been going on in the area since 2002."}],"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","sizes":[],"metadataVersion":2,"types":{"schemaOrg":"ScholarlyArticle","resourceTypeGeneral":"Text","citeproc":"article-journal","bibtex":"article","ris":"JOUR","resourceType":"Journal article"},"isActive":true,"relatedIdentifiers":[],"created":"2014-02-19T13:50:29Z","identifiers":[],"subjects":[{"subject":"Artisanal refining;"},{"subject":"groundwater;"},{"subject":"infiltration;"},{"subject":"permeability;"},{"subject":"vulnerability;"},{"subject":"aquifer;"},{"subject":"pollution."}],"dates":[{"date":"2012-03-07","dateType":"Issued"}],"published":"2012-03-07","titles":[{"title":"Assessing Groundwater Vulnerability To The Activities Of Artisanal Refining In Bolo And Environs, Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area Of Rivers State; Nigeria"}],"geoLocations":[],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/8401","rightsList":[{"rightsUri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0"},{"rightsUri":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","rights":"Open Access"}],"publicationYear":2012,"publisher":"Zenodo","contentUrl":null,"contributors":[],"updated":"2020-07-28T08:23:23Z","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8401","alternateIdentifiers":[],"state":"findable","version":null}
